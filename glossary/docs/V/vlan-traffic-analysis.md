# What is VLAN traffic analysis?

**VLAN traffic analysis** is the process of monitoring and analyzing network traffic associated with Virtual LANs (VLANs).

While traditional traffic analysis focuses on hosts, applications, and IP addresses, VLAN traffic analysis adds another layer of context by showing how traffic is distributed across logical network segments.

This helps operators understand how different parts of the network are being used, how traffic moves between segments, and whether segmentation policies are functioning as intended.

---

## Why VLAN traffic analysis matters

Networks are often divided into VLANs to separate users, departments, services, security zones, or operational functions.

Without VLAN visibility, traffic analysis may show who is communicating but not which network segment the traffic belongs to. VLAN traffic analysis provides this segmentation context, making it easier to understand how traffic is distributed across the network.

For example, the same traffic volume may have very different operational implications depending on whether it originates from a guest network, a server VLAN, a production environment, or a finance segment.

By analyzing traffic at the VLAN level, operators can understand network behavior within individual segments rather than viewing the network as a single flat environment.

---

## How VLAN traffic analysis works

VLAN traffic analysis relies on packet data, flow records, or network telemetry that includes VLAN identifiers.

By grouping traffic according to VLAN IDs, operators can analyze utilization, host activity, application usage, communication patterns, and traffic distribution within individual network segments.

Depending on the monitoring architecture, VLAN information may be obtained from:

- Packet captures containing 802.1Q tags
- Flow records that export VLAN identifiers
- Network telemetry platforms that track VLAN membership

This enables visibility into network activity at the segmentation layer rather than solely at the IP-address level.

## VLAN traffic analysis in network operations

VLAN traffic analysis is commonly used for troubleshooting, capacity planning, security monitoring, segmentation validation, and operational reporting.

It helps operators identify heavily utilized VLANs, understand traffic growth trends, investigate unusual activity, and examine communication between network segments.

VLAN-level visibility is particularly useful for validating network design assumptions. Traffic patterns can reveal whether segmentation policies are functioning correctly or whether communication is occurring between VLANs in unexpected ways.

Because many enterprise and campus networks rely heavily on VLAN-based segmentation, VLAN analysis often provides operational insight that is not immediately visible through interface-level statistics alone.

## Common VLAN analysis metrics

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| VLAN utilization | Traffic volume associated with a VLAN |
| Top VLANs | VLANs generating the most traffic |
| Intra-VLAN traffic | Communication within the same VLAN |
| Inter-VLAN traffic | Communication between VLANs |
| Top hosts per VLAN | Most active hosts within a VLAN |
| VLAN growth trends | Changes in utilization over time |

These metrics help operators understand both how individual segments are used and how those segments interact with the rest of the network.

## In Trisul

Trisul Network Analytics can analyze VLAN-related traffic when VLAN information is available through packet captures or flow records that include VLAN identifiers.

By incorporating VLAN context into traffic and flow analysis, Trisul helps operators understand traffic distribution across network segments, investigate communication patterns, examine inter-VLAN activity, monitor utilization, and support segmentation-aware troubleshooting and capacity-planning workflows.

These capabilities are particularly useful in enterprise, campus, data-center, and service-provider environments where VLAN-based segmentation plays an important role in network design.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is VLAN traffic analysis?

VLAN traffic analysis is the process of monitoring and analyzing network traffic associated with Virtual LANs (VLANs). It helps operators understand how traffic is distributed across logical network segments and how those segments communicate with one another.

### How does VLAN traffic analysis work?

VLAN traffic analysis uses packet data, flow records, or network telemetry that includes VLAN identifiers. Traffic can then be grouped and analyzed by VLAN to understand utilization, communication patterns, and traffic distribution across network segments.

### Why analyze VLAN traffic?

VLAN traffic analysis helps operators understand network segmentation, validate design policies, troubleshoot traffic issues, monitor utilization, and analyze communication between network segments.

### What does VLAN analysis reveal?

VLAN analysis can reveal traffic distribution, utilization trends, communication patterns, top hosts, inter-VLAN traffic, and how different network segments are being used.

### Why is VLAN visibility important?

VLAN visibility provides segmentation context that is not available from IP addresses alone. It helps operators understand how traffic is distributed across logical network boundaries and how different segments interact.

### Can VLAN traffic analysis help validate segmentation policies?

Yes. VLAN traffic analysis can reveal communication patterns between segments and help identify traffic that may not align with intended network-segmentation policies.
