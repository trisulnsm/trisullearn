# What is Visibility Fabric?

**Visibility Fabric** is a network architecture that collects, aggregates, and distributes traffic from multiple observation points to monitoring and analytics platforms.

Modern networks often span data centers, branch offices, cloud environments, virtual infrastructure, and remote locations. As networks become more distributed, traffic visibility can become fragmented. Visibility Fabrics help solve this problem by centralizing access to network traffic and making it available to the tools that need it.

Rather than connecting monitoring tools directly to every observation point, a Visibility Fabric provides a scalable way to collect, process, and distribute traffic across the environment.

## Why is Visibility Fabric important?

Network visibility is only useful if relevant traffic can reach monitoring and analytics platforms.

Visibility Fabrics help eliminate blind spots by providing consistent access to traffic from distributed parts of the infrastructure. This improves monitoring coverage, simplifies operational workflows, and reduces the complexity of large-scale monitoring deployments.

The result is a more efficient visibility architecture that can support performance monitoring, security operations, troubleshooting, packet analysis, flow analytics, and historical investigations.

## How Visibility Fabric works

A Visibility Fabric gathers traffic from observation sources such as network TAPs, SPAN ports, virtual taps, cloud traffic mirrors, and other monitoring points.

The traffic is then aggregated, filtered, replicated, or distributed through visibility infrastructure such as packet brokers before being delivered to monitoring and analytics platforms.

This architecture allows multiple tools to access relevant traffic without requiring direct connections to every observation point in the network.

## Visibility Fabric in network operations

Visibility Fabrics are commonly used in enterprise networks, data centers, cloud environments, service-provider infrastructures, and hybrid deployments.

Operations teams use Visibility Fabrics to improve monitoring coverage, simplify traffic collection, support distributed environments, and ensure that monitoring platforms receive the traffic required for analysis and investigations.

Because modern infrastructures continue to expand across physical, virtual, and cloud environments, Visibility Fabrics play an important role in maintaining consistent network visibility.

## In Trisul

A Visibility Fabric solves the problem of collecting and distributing traffic across the network. Trisul Network Analytics helps transform that traffic into operational insight.

Trisul can analyze packet data, flow telemetry, and traffic statistics delivered through TAPs, SPAN ports, packet brokers, and other visibility infrastructure. By combining traffic visibility with flow analytics, packet analysis, historical retention, and investigation workflows, Trisul helps operators understand network behavior and investigate operational issues.

These deployments are common in enterprise, data center, ISP, and security-monitoring environments where centralized traffic visibility is important.

For flow monitoring and packet analytics guidance, see the Trisul documentation:
