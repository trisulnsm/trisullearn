# What is a VRF?

A **VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding)** is a technology that allows multiple independent routing tables to coexist on the same router or Layer 3 device.

A routing table determines how packets are forwarded through a network. By maintaining separate routing tables, a device can make completely independent forwarding decisions for different traffic domains.

As a result, a single router can behave as though it were multiple independent routers, each with its own routes, interfaces, and network view.

VRFs are commonly used to provide **Layer 3 segmentation**, allowing multiple logical networks to share the same physical infrastructure while remaining isolated from one another.

---

## How VRFs work

Under normal conditions, a router maintains a single routing table. With VRFs, the router maintains multiple routing tables simultaneously.

Interfaces are assigned to specific VRFs, and traffic entering a VRF is forwarded only according to that VRF's routing information. Routes learned within one VRF are typically invisible to other VRFs unless explicit route-sharing mechanisms are configured.

This separation enables multiple independent routing domains to operate on the same device without interfering with one another.

For example, two customers can use the same private IP address range without creating routing conflicts because each customer's traffic remains within its own VRF.

---

## Why VRFs matter

VRFs provide strong traffic isolation without requiring separate physical routers for every network.

They are widely used in service-provider, MPLS VPN, enterprise, managed-services, and multi-tenant environments where multiple networks must share infrastructure while maintaining independent routing policies.

The ability to support overlapping IP address spaces is one of the most important advantages of VRFs. Because each routing domain is isolated, identical IP addresses can exist in different VRFs and represent completely different systems.

This makes VRFs a foundational technology for scalable multi-tenant networking.

---

## VRF vs VLAN

Both VRFs and VLANs provide network segmentation, but they operate at different layers.

| Concept | Layer | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| VLAN | Layer 2 | Segments broadcast domains and local network traffic |
| VRF | Layer 3 | Separates routing domains and forwarding decisions |

A useful way to think about this distinction is that VLANs provide segmentation at Layer 2, while VRFs provide segmentation at Layer 3.

The two technologies are often used together. A VLAN can separate traffic within a local network segment, while a VRF provides routing isolation for that segment.

---

## VRFs in network operations

When analyzing network traffic, VRF context is often as important as IP addresses.

In multi-tenant environments, the same IP address may appear in multiple VRFs and refer to entirely different systems. Without VRF visibility, traffic records and routing behavior may be difficult to interpret correctly.

For this reason, operators often analyze traffic, utilization, routing activity, and communication patterns within the context of the appropriate VRF rather than viewing the network as a single routing domain.

## In Trisul

VRFs are relevant in environments where traffic analysis must account for multiple routing domains.

When VRF information is included in exported telemetry, Trisul can use that context to analyze traffic patterns, utilization, communication behavior, and network activity within the appropriate routing domain.

This visibility is particularly valuable in service-provider, MPLS VPN, managed-services, cloud, and multi-tenant environments where routing isolation is a fundamental design requirement.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is a VRF?

A VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding) is a technology that allows multiple independent routing tables to coexist on the same router or Layer 3 device. It enables Layer 3 segmentation, traffic isolation, and multi-tenant networking on shared infrastructure.

### Why are VRFs used?

VRFs are used to isolate routing domains, support multi-tenant environments, separate customer networks, and allow overlapping IP address spaces on shared infrastructure.

### How is a VRF different from a VLAN?

A VLAN provides Layer 2 segmentation, while a VRF provides Layer 3 routing separation. VLANs isolate broadcast domains, whereas VRFs isolate routing tables and forwarding decisions.

### Why are overlapping IP addresses possible with VRFs?

Because each VRF maintains an independent routing table, the same IP address can exist in multiple VRFs without creating routing conflicts.

### Can a router have multiple VRFs?

Yes. A single router can maintain multiple VRFs simultaneously, each operating as an independent routing domain with its own routes and forwarding decisions.

### Why is VRF visibility important?

VRF visibility helps operators understand traffic and routing behavior within the correct routing domain, which is essential in multi-tenant and overlapping-address environments.
