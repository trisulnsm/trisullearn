# What is VoIP traffic monitoring?

**VoIP traffic monitoring** is the process of analyzing Voice over IP traffic and network-performance metrics to understand call quality, troubleshoot voice issues, and ensure reliable real-time communications.

Unlike many other applications, voice communication occurs in real time. Delayed or missing packets cannot always be recovered without affecting the conversation, making VoIP highly sensitive to network conditions.

For this reason, VoIP monitoring focuses on understanding how network performance affects voice quality and user experience.

---

## Why VoIP monitoring matters

Voice traffic places different demands on a network than applications such as email, file transfers, or web browsing.

A delayed email may go unnoticed, but excessive latency during a phone call can create awkward conversation delays. Jitter can result in choppy audio, while packet loss may cause missing words, audio distortion, or degraded call quality.

Because even relatively small network issues can affect voice communications, VoIP monitoring plays an important role in maintaining service quality and identifying the causes of user complaints.

---

## How VoIP monitoring works

VoIP monitoring combines signaling visibility, media-stream analysis, and network-performance measurements to understand both call behavior and call quality.

Depending on the monitoring architecture and available telemetry, operators may analyze RTP streams, SIP signaling, packet captures, flow records, QoS measurements, or application-aware traffic data.

These measurements help determine whether network conditions are affecting voice communications and assist with troubleshooting call-quality issues.

## Common VoIP quality metrics

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Latency | Delay experienced by voice traffic |
| Jitter | Variation in packet arrival times |
| Packet loss | Missing voice packets |
| Call setup success | Successful call establishment rate |
| Call duration | Length of voice sessions |
| MOS | Estimated user-perceived call quality |

Together, these metrics help operators understand both network performance and the quality of the user experience.

## What VoIP monitoring reveals

VoIP monitoring helps correlate network conditions with voice quality.

It can reveal whether call-quality problems are associated with latency, jitter, packet loss, congestion, routing issues, QoS policy problems, or other network conditions that affect real-time communications.

This visibility helps operators move beyond knowing that users are experiencing poor call quality to understanding why those problems are occurring.

## In Trisul

VoIP traffic monitoring is relevant to Trisul Network Analytics because voice quality is heavily influenced by network behavior.

Trisul can provide visibility into RTP traffic patterns, VoIP-related traffic flows, network utilization, packet-loss symptoms, latency-related indicators, and QoS-related traffic behavior. This visibility can help operators investigate voice-quality issues and understand how network conditions affect VoIP services.

However, Trisul documentation does not explicitly state that it performs MOS score calculation or dedicated end-user voice-quality scoring. Such capabilities should not be assumed without validation.
