# What is a VLAN?

A **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)** is a logical Layer 2 network segment that creates separate broadcast domains within the same physical network infrastructure.

VLANs allow administrators to logically separate devices and traffic without requiring dedicated physical switches or cabling. Devices assigned to the same VLAN behave as though they are connected to the same local network, even when they share the same switching infrastructure.

VLANs are widely used for network segmentation, traffic isolation, security enforcement, multi-tenant environments, and operational organization.

## How VLANs work

VLANs use Layer 2 tagging mechanisms, commonly based on IEEE 802.1Q, to identify which logical network a frame belongs to.

Switches use VLAN identifiers (VLAN IDs) to keep traffic separated between network segments. Devices within the same VLAN can communicate directly at Layer 2, while communication between VLANs typically requires routing through a Layer 3 device such as a router, Layer 3 switch, or firewall.

This approach allows multiple logical networks to coexist on the same physical infrastructure while maintaining traffic separation.

## VLANs in network operations

VLANs are a fundamental building block of modern network design.

Organizations use VLANs to separate users, servers, applications, departments, services, and customer environments into distinct network segments. This improves security, simplifies administration, and helps control how traffic moves across the network.

From an operational perspective, VLAN visibility helps operators understand how traffic behaves within and between network segments. This visibility is valuable for troubleshooting, utilization analysis, segmentation validation, capacity planning, and identifying abnormal traffic patterns.

## What makes VLAN visibility useful?

Creating network segments is only part of the solution. Operators also need visibility into how those segments are being used.

VLAN-level visibility helps answer questions such as:

- Which VLANs generate the most traffic?
- Which network segments communicate most frequently?
- Are segmentation policies behaving as expected?
- Which VLANs are experiencing congestion or abnormal activity?

Understanding traffic behavior at the VLAN level provides important context during troubleshooting, performance monitoring, security investigations, and network planning activities.

## In Trisul

VLAN visibility is highly relevant to Trisul Network Analytics because VLANs are commonly used to segment modern networks.

When VLAN information is available in packet captures or flow telemetry, Trisul helps operators analyze traffic behavior within and between VLANs, understand utilization patterns, identify communication trends, and investigate segmentation-related issues.

These workflows are particularly useful in enterprise, data center, ISP, and multi-tenant environments where understanding traffic distribution across network segments is important for operational visibility and troubleshooting.

For flow monitoring and traffic analytics guidance, see the Trisul documentation:
