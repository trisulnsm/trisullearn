# What is Wireshark?

**Wireshark** is an open-source packet analyzer used to capture, inspect, and analyze network traffic at the packet level.

It is one of the most widely used network analysis tools and provides detailed visibility into individual packets and protocol exchanges. This makes it particularly useful for troubleshooting, protocol analysis, security investigations, application diagnostics, and packet-level forensics.

Unlike flow monitoring or summary statistics, Wireshark allows analysts to examine the actual network communications taking place between systems.

## How Wireshark works

Wireshark captures or imports packet data and decodes network protocols so analysts can examine traffic across multiple layers of the network stack.

Packet analysis can reveal source and destination addresses, protocol behavior, connection establishment, application transactions, timing information, and communication errors.

Because it operates at the packet level, Wireshark can reveal issues that may not be visible through flow records, counters, dashboards, or other higher-level monitoring systems.

## Wireshark in network operations

Wireshark is commonly used when higher-level monitoring identifies a problem but does not fully explain its cause.

Operators frequently use packet analysis to investigate connectivity issues, packet loss, TCP behavior, application problems, protocol errors, performance degradation, and security-related events.

Packet-level visibility is particularly valuable when detailed evidence is required to understand exactly how a communication occurred and why a problem is happening.

For this reason, Wireshark is often used as part of a broader investigation workflow rather than as the first step in network analysis.

## What makes Wireshark useful?

Wireshark provides visibility into the packet, the fundamental unit of network communication.

Its greatest strength is the ability to answer questions that higher-level monitoring tools cannot. While dashboards, counters, and flow analytics can help identify where a problem exists, packet analysis often explains why the problem is occurring.

Because packet analysis generates large amounts of detailed information, Wireshark is most effective when analysts already have a specific issue, traffic flow, application, or communication pattern they want to investigate.

## In Trisul

Wireshark is complementary to Trisul Network Analytics.

Trisul helps operators identify traffic patterns, investigate network behavior, analyze flows, and narrow investigations to specific hosts, applications, conversations, and traffic events. When packet-level inspection is required, analysts can retrieve or export packet data and use Wireshark to examine the underlying communications in greater detail.

This workflow allows operators to move efficiently from large-scale traffic visibility to detailed packet-level evidence when troubleshooting performance issues, investigating incidents, or analyzing protocol behavior.

For flow monitoring and packet-analysis workflows, see the Trisul documentation:
