# What is webhook integration?

**Webhook integration** is a method of automatically sending HTTP notifications to external systems when specific events occur.

A webhook acts as an event-driven communication mechanism. Rather than waiting for another system to request information, the source system automatically delivers information when a relevant event takes place.

This makes webhooks a common way to connect monitoring, analytics, security, and operational platforms with external tools and workflows.

---

## Why webhook integration matters

Without webhooks, external systems often need to repeatedly query an API to determine whether new events have occurred. This approach, known as polling, can create unnecessary overhead and delays.

Webhooks eliminate this requirement by automatically sending information when an event occurs.

As a result, systems can react more quickly to alerts, status changes, anomalies, and operational events without continuously checking for updates.

The primary benefit of webhook integration is that information is delivered when something happens rather than when another system asks for it.

---

## How webhook integration works

A webhook consists of a configured HTTP endpoint that receives event information from another system.

When a predefined event occurs, the source system automatically sends an HTTP request containing information about that event to the destination endpoint.

The receiving system can then process the information, create tickets, send notifications, trigger workflows, launch automation processes, or perform other actions based on the event.

Because delivery is event-driven, webhook integrations are commonly used in environments where rapid response and operational coordination are important.

## Webhooks and event-driven architecture

Webhooks are a common building block in **event-driven architectures**, where systems react to events as they occur rather than periodically checking for changes.

This approach helps reduce operational delay and enables automated workflows that span multiple platforms.

For example, a monitoring alert can automatically trigger a notification, create a support ticket, initiate an incident-response workflow, or launch an automation process without requiring manual intervention.

## Webhook integration vs API integration

| Category | Webhook Integration | API Integration |
|---|---|---|
| Communication model | Event-driven | Request-driven |
| Data delivery | Automatic push | Query-based retrieval |
| Trigger | Event occurrence | Client request |
| Information flow | System sends data automatically | Client requests data |
| Best fit | Alerting and automation | Reporting and data access |

A useful way to think about the difference is:

- APIs answer questions.
- Webhooks announce events.

The two technologies are often used together within the same integration architecture.

## In Trisul

Webhook integrations can help extend Trisul-generated alerts and operational events into broader monitoring, notification, ticketing, security, and automation workflows.

By forwarding event information to external systems automatically, webhooks help connect Trisul to event-driven operational processes that span multiple tools and teams.

This is particularly useful in NOC, SOC, ISP, and enterprise environments where rapid event propagation and workflow automation are important.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is webhook integration?

Webhook integration is a method of automatically sending HTTP notifications to external systems when specific events occur. It enables event-driven communication, workflow automation, and real-time operational integrations.

### Why are webhooks useful?

Webhooks allow systems to automatically deliver information when events occur, eliminating the need for external systems to repeatedly check for updates.

### How are webhooks different from APIs?

Webhooks are event-driven and automatically send information when an event occurs, whereas APIs are typically request-driven and require a client to query for data.

### Can webhooks support automation?

Yes. Webhooks are commonly used to trigger notifications, ticketing workflows, SIEM integrations, automation platforms, and incident-response processes.

### What is polling?

Polling is a technique where a system repeatedly queries another system to determine whether new information is available. Webhooks reduce the need for polling by automatically sending information when events occur.

### Are webhooks real-time?

Webhooks are typically near real-time because event information is delivered immediately after the triggering event occurs, subject to network and processing delays.
