# What is MRTG?

**MRTG (Multi Router Traffic Grapher)** is a network monitoring tool that collects numerical metrics from devices and converts them into historical graphs.

Originally designed to monitor router interfaces through SNMP, MRTG became one of the most widely used monitoring tools because it made network behavior visible through trend analysis rather than raw counters.

A useful way to think about MRTG is:

> **MRTG transforms device counters into historical trends.**

Instead of viewing isolated measurements, administrators can see how utilization changes over time, making it easier to identify growth patterns, recurring issues, and long-term infrastructure needs.

---

## Why MRTG became important

Before graphical monitoring tools became common, administrators often relied on raw device counters and command-line output to understand network activity.

While the data existed, understanding long-term trends was difficult.

MRTG changed this by automatically collecting measurements and presenting them as historical graphs.

For the first time, network administrators could easily answer questions such as:

- Is bandwidth utilization increasing?
- Which interfaces are approaching capacity?
- Are performance issues recurring?
- How has infrastructure usage changed over time?

This ability to visualize trends helped make MRTG one of the most influential network-monitoring tools of its era.

---

## How MRTG works

MRTG periodically polls network devices and retrieves numerical counters, most commonly through SNMP.

These counters typically represent cumulative values such as:

- Bytes transmitted
- Packets processed
- CPU utilization
- Memory usage
- Device-specific performance metrics

The collected values are processed and stored as time-series data. MRTG then generates graphs that show how measurements change over time.

Because MRTG relies on periodic polling, it provides summarized visibility into infrastructure performance rather than detailed analysis of individual packets, applications, or traffic conversations.

---

## MRTG in network operations

MRTG became widely adopted because it provided a simple and reliable way to monitor infrastructure utilization.

Network teams commonly used MRTG for:

- Bandwidth monitoring
- Interface utilization tracking
- Capacity planning
- Infrastructure trend analysis
- Performance monitoring

Its greatest strength is helping administrators understand long-term behavior.

For example, a bandwidth graph can reveal whether utilization is growing steadily over months, helping organizations plan upgrades before capacity becomes a problem.

This trend-oriented approach remains useful even in modern environments.

---

## Capacity planning and trend analysis

One of MRTG's most important contributions is its support for capacity planning.

Rather than focusing solely on current conditions, MRTG helps organizations understand how infrastructure usage changes over time.

Historical graphs make it easier to identify:

- Growth trends
- Seasonal patterns
- Recurring utilization peaks
- Infrastructure bottlenecks
- Long-term capacity requirements

This allows administrators to make planning decisions based on observed behavior rather than assumptions.

In many environments, this remains one of the most valuable uses of MRTG-style monitoring.

## MRTG vs Flow Analytics

| Category | MRTG | Flow Analytics |
|----------|------|----------------|
| Data source | SNMP and numerical counters | NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, and flow records |
| Visibility | Device and interface metrics | Traffic conversations and communication patterns |
| Application awareness | Limited | Detailed |
| Traffic attribution | Limited | High |
| Analytical focus | Utilization monitoring and trending | Traffic analysis and investigation |
| Best fit | Infrastructure monitoring and capacity planning | Network visibility and traffic intelligence |

MRTG answers questions such as:

- How much bandwidth was consumed?
- How heavily utilized was an interface?

Flow analytics answers questions such as:

- Who generated the traffic?
- Which applications were involved?
- Where did the traffic go?

Both approaches provide value, but they operate at different levels of visibility.

---

## What makes MRTG effective

MRTG works best when the goal is understanding long-term trends rather than short-duration events.

The quality of monitoring depends on reliable device counters, accurate SNMP configuration, and appropriate polling intervals.

Longer polling intervals reduce monitoring overhead but may hide short-lived spikes. Shorter intervals provide greater detail but increase collection activity.

Understanding these trade-offs helps ensure that collected data accurately reflects infrastructure behavior.

MRTG is most effective when used for utilization monitoring, trend analysis, and capacity planning rather than detailed traffic investigations.

## In Trisul

MRTG is not part of Trisul, but it remains relevant because it represents a traditional approach to network monitoring based on device counters and SNMP polling.

MRTG focuses on answering questions about utilization and infrastructure performance.

Trisul extends visibility through flow analytics, packet analysis, protocol analytics, traffic investigations, Counter Groups, and historical behavioral analysis.

While MRTG helps administrators understand how much activity occurred, Trisul helps explain who generated that activity, which applications were involved, how communication occurred, and how network behavior changes over time.

The two approaches address different operational needs, with MRTG focusing on infrastructure metrics and Trisul focusing on network visibility and traffic intelligence.
