# What is micro segmentation?

**Micro segmentation** is a security approach that applies granular communication controls between workloads, applications, hosts, and services in order to reduce implicit trust and restrict lateral movement across modern distributed environments.

Traditional segmentation models relied heavily on perimeter-oriented trust boundaries such as VLANs, DMZs, or broad internal network zones. Modern cloud, virtualization, and east-west traffic environments weakened these assumptions because workloads now communicate dynamically across highly interconnected infrastructure where broad internal trust can significantly increase the blast radius of compromise.

Micro segmentation addresses this problem by enforcing communication policies closer to individual workloads and services so that only explicitly permitted traffic paths are allowed.

Instead of broadly trusting internal communication, organizations can restrict unnecessary east-west traffic, reduce unauthorized service access, and limit how attackers or compromised systems move across the environment after an initial breach.

Micro segmentation is therefore closely associated with Zero Trust architectures where communication is continuously validated rather than implicitly trusted based only on network location.

## How micro segmentation works

Micro segmentation creates smaller trust boundaries around workloads, applications, containers, services, or infrastructure components in order to control communication behavior more precisely.

Policies define which systems are allowed to communicate, which protocols may be used, and which application relationships are operationally necessary. Traffic that does not match policy may be blocked, monitored, logged, or restricted depending on the enforcement model being used.

Operationally, the difficult part of micro segmentation is not simply enforcing policies, but accurately understanding real communication behavior before restrictive controls are introduced.

Modern applications often depend on complex east-west communication involving APIs, databases, orchestration systems, cloud services, identity platforms, and distributed application components. Incomplete visibility into these dependencies can lead to segmentation blind spots, operational outages, or over-permissive policies that weaken security objectives.

Successful segmentation strategies therefore depend heavily on visibility into workload relationships, application dependencies, and historical traffic behavior across the environment.

## Why micro segmentation matters in network operations

Micro segmentation became operationally important because many modern attacks rely heavily on unrestricted east-west communication after initial compromise occurs.

Once attackers gain access to an internal system, broad trust relationships may allow lateral movement, internal reconnaissance, unauthorized service access, malware propagation, or cross-environment compromise across interconnected workloads.

This risk is amplified in cloud and data-center environments where workloads communicate dynamically across distributed infrastructure and traditional perimeter-based isolation no longer provides sufficient internal protection.

Micro segmentation reduces this exposure by limiting unnecessary communication paths and narrowing trusted relationships between systems.

Operationally, however, segmentation effectiveness depends heavily on maintaining accurate visibility into evolving communication behavior over time. As workloads move, cloud infrastructure scales dynamically, and application dependencies change continuously, segmentation policies must adapt without disrupting legitimate operational traffic.

This makes telemetry visibility and traffic analysis operationally critical for successful segmentation workflows.

## Micro segmentation vs network segmentation

| Model | Operational scope |
|---|---|
| Network segmentation | Broad trust zones such as user, server, or DMZ networks |
| Micro segmentation | Granular workload-, application-, or service-level communication control |
| Traditional segmentation focus | Perimeter-oriented isolation |
| Micro segmentation focus | East-west trust reduction and workload-level policy enforcement |

Micro segmentation extends traditional segmentation by applying controls closer to workloads and communication behavior rather than relying primarily on large internal trust zones.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports micro-segmentation-related visibility workflows through flow telemetry analysis, historical traffic visibility, east-west traffic investigations, and workload communication analysis.

Using NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, J-Flow, packet analysis, and historical traffic analytics, Trisul helps operators observe how workloads, hosts, applications, and services communicate across distributed environments over time.

These workflows help teams validate segmentation assumptions, investigate east-west traffic relationships, identify unexpected communication paths, analyze workload dependencies, and correlate traffic behavior associated with lateral-movement investigations or internal security analysis.

This becomes especially valuable in cloud, Zero Trust, data-center, multi-tenant, and hybrid-network environments where segmentation accuracy depends heavily on continuous visibility into real communication behavior.

Additional traffic-analysis workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:
