# What is an MSP?

An **MSP (Managed Service Provider)** is a company that remotely manages IT, network, monitoring, or operational services for other organizations using centralized operational workflows and shared infrastructure.

MSPs are commonly used in enterprise, ISP, cloud, telecom, and managed-network environments where organizations want continuous operational coverage, centralized monitoring, infrastructure visibility, or specialized operational expertise without building and maintaining large internal operations teams.

In network operations, MSPs often manage multiple customer environments simultaneously from centralized operational platforms. This allows operators to monitor infrastructure health, traffic behavior, service availability, alerts, reporting workflows, and operational events across distributed customer environments from a shared monitoring infrastructure.

Because MSPs support many customers in parallel, operational visibility becomes significantly more complex than single-network monitoring. Monitoring systems must provide customer separation, tenant-aware reporting, historical visibility, alert isolation, and infrastructure segmentation without exposing one customer’s telemetry or operational data to another.

This makes centralized telemetry visibility and multi-tenant operational workflows critically important in MSP environments.

## How MSP operations work

MSPs typically manage customer environments remotely through centralized monitoring and operational workflows rather than maintaining dedicated operational infrastructure separately for every customer.

Operational teams monitor telemetry, infrastructure health, traffic activity, alerts, service availability, and operational analytics across multiple environments simultaneously while maintaining logical separation between customer networks and reporting data.

In practice, MSP workflows often involve continuous monitoring, incident investigation, troubleshooting, reporting, operational escalation, utilization analysis, and infrastructure review across many customer environments at the same time.

This creates operational challenges involving:
- tenant isolation
- alert management
- historical reporting
- telemetry segmentation
- customer-specific visibility
- SLA monitoring
- operational scalability

As customer environments grow larger and more distributed, MSPs depend heavily on monitoring systems capable of correlating telemetry and operational data efficiently without losing customer-level separation or visibility accuracy.

## MSPs in network operations

In network operations, MSPs frequently manage WAN environments, enterprise infrastructure, cloud connectivity, subscriber environments, branch-office networks, or managed customer services where continuous visibility into traffic and operational behavior is required.

Operationally, MSP environments depend heavily on:
- centralized telemetry visibility
- customer-specific dashboards
- multi-tenant reporting
- historical traffic analysis
- SLA visibility
- alert correlation
- long-term operational analytics

Historical visibility is especially important because MSPs must often review customer incidents, validate SLA compliance, analyze recurring operational problems, investigate bandwidth growth, and compare infrastructure behavior across long reporting periods.

Unlike isolated enterprise monitoring environments, MSP workflows must scale operational visibility across many customers simultaneously without creating reporting confusion, telemetry overlap, or customer-data exposure.

This makes segmentation, reporting consistency, and tenant-aware operational visibility foundational requirements in managed-services environments.

## Common MSP monitoring requirements

| Requirement | Operational importance |
|---|---|
| Multi-tenant visibility | Separates customer telemetry and operational data |
| Historical reporting | Supports SLA review, incident analysis, and trend visibility |
| Alert isolation | Prevents operational overlap between customer environments |
| Dashboard segmentation | Provides customer-specific operational visibility |
| Long-term analytics | Helps analyze recurring utilization and infrastructure trends |

Monitoring platforms used by MSPs must scale operational visibility across multiple customer environments without sacrificing telemetry accuracy or customer isolation.

## What makes MSP operations operationally effective

Operationally effective MSP environments depend heavily on centralized visibility, accurate telemetry, reporting consistency, operational scalability, and strong customer-level separation across shared monitoring infrastructure.

Incomplete telemetry visibility, inconsistent reporting workflows, weak tenant isolation, or fragmented operational tooling can significantly reduce operational efficiency and make troubleshooting or SLA validation difficult across large customer environments.

This is why MSP workflows rely heavily on platforms capable of combining traffic visibility, historical analytics, reporting workflows, utilization analysis, alerting, and customer segmentation into unified operational views.

As infrastructure environments become increasingly distributed across cloud, WAN, hybrid-network, and multi-site deployments, centralized operational visibility becomes one of the most important capabilities for managed-service environments.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports MSP-oriented operational workflows through flow telemetry analysis, historical traffic visibility, reporting workflows, long-term analytics, and multi-tenant operational visibility capabilities.

Using NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, J-Flow, packet analysis, and historical traffic analytics, Trisul helps MSP operators monitor traffic behavior, analyze customer environments, investigate operational issues, review long-term utilization trends, and generate customer-specific reporting workflows across multiple managed networks.

These workflows help MSPs maintain customer-level visibility, analyze traffic growth, investigate incidents, validate SLA-related operational behavior, and manage large distributed customer environments without requiring isolated monitoring infrastructure for every tenant.

This becomes especially valuable in enterprise MSP, ISP, WAN-management, telecom, and multi-tenant monitoring environments where centralized operational visibility and historical analytics are operationally critical.

Additional monitoring and analytics workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:
