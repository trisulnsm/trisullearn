# What is machine learning in network analytics?

**Machine learning** is a method of using statistical models to identify patterns, classify data, detect anomalies, or make predictions from historical information.

In network analytics, machine learning is commonly used to analyze traffic behavior, identify anomalies, reduce operational noise, and detect patterns that static threshold-based monitoring may struggle to interpret reliably in dynamic environments.

Traditional monitoring systems often depend heavily on fixed thresholds and manually configured rules. While effective for many operational scenarios, these static approaches become harder to manage in modern environments where cloud workloads, application behavior, east-west traffic patterns, and infrastructure activity change continuously over time.

Machine learning helps address this limitation by analyzing behavioral patterns across telemetry and historical traffic data rather than relying entirely on predefined operational conditions.

Instead of manually defining every possible anomaly condition, machine-learning workflows can identify unusual traffic shifts, abnormal communication patterns, irregular utilization behavior, or unexpected operational activity by comparing current telemetry against learned behavioral baselines.

Operationally, machine learning in networking is used less as an autonomous decision-making system and more as a behavioral-analysis layer that helps operators interpret changing infrastructure conditions more effectively.

## How machine learning works in network analytics

Machine-learning workflows analyze historical telemetry, flow records, time-series metrics, traffic behavior, and operational patterns in order to identify recurring behavioral characteristics across the environment.

Rather than depending entirely on manually written rules, machine-learning models build statistical baselines from observed network activity and compare new telemetry against those learned patterns over time.

This allows monitoring systems to identify traffic conditions that appear operationally unusual even when they do not violate predefined thresholds directly.

For example, machine-learning workflows may detect subtle changes in traffic composition, abnormal host communication behavior, irregular bandwidth usage, or unusual operational patterns that static monitoring rules might overlook or classify incorrectly.

This becomes especially valuable in large and highly dynamic environments where manually maintaining thresholds for every workload, application, or communication pattern can generate excessive operational noise or leave important anomalies undetected.

Operationally, the effectiveness of machine-learning analysis depends heavily on telemetry quality, historical visibility, baseline accuracy, and the consistency of the underlying operational data. Poor-quality telemetry, incomplete baselines, or inconsistent behavioral visibility can significantly reduce the reliability of anomaly analysis and forecasting workflows.

Machine learning therefore works best as a behavioral-analysis capability built on top of strong telemetry visibility and historical network analytics rather than as a standalone operational solution.

## Why machine learning matters in network operations

Modern infrastructure environments generate highly dynamic traffic behavior that can be difficult to interpret using static monitoring rules alone.

Cloud environments scale continuously, application traffic patterns evolve rapidly, workloads move across infrastructure dynamically, and east-west communication behavior changes constantly over time. In these conditions, static thresholds may either miss subtle operational anomalies or generate large volumes of low-value alerts.

Machine learning helps operators analyze these environments more behaviorally by identifying deviations from expected traffic patterns rather than relying only on manually configured threshold conditions.

This is particularly useful in anomaly detection, behavioral baselining, forecasting, traffic-pattern analysis, operational prioritization, and noise reduction workflows where infrastructure behavior changes continuously over time.

Operationally, however, machine learning does not replace visibility, telemetry analysis, or human investigation. Machine-learning workflows are only as useful as the telemetry quality and operational context supporting them.

In practice, machine learning is most effective when combined with strong traffic visibility, historical telemetry, behavioral analytics, and operational investigation workflows that help teams interpret why infrastructure behavior changed in the first place.

## Machine learning vs rule-based monitoring

| Model | Operational approach |
|---|---|
| Rule-based monitoring | Uses fixed thresholds and manually defined conditions |
| Machine learning | Identifies behavioral patterns and deviations statistically |
| Rule-based strength | Predictable and easy to control |
| Machine-learning strength | Adapts better to evolving traffic behavior |

Both approaches are operationally valuable and are often used together in modern network analytics environments.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports machine-learning-related workflows by providing high-resolution telemetry, historical traffic visibility, behavioral analytics data, and flow-based operational context that can support anomaly analysis and external machine-learning workflows.

Using NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, J-Flow, packet analysis, time-series metrics, and historical traffic analytics, Trisul helps operators observe traffic behavior, investigate anomalies, analyze communication patterns, and correlate operational changes across large environments over time.

Rather than functioning as a standalone AI-training platform, Trisul acts primarily as a telemetry, visibility, and analytics layer that helps operators and external analytical systems work with behavioral network data more effectively.

This becomes especially valuable in environments where anomaly detection, forecasting, behavioral baselining, or operational analytics depend heavily on accurate historical visibility and consistent telemetry quality.

Additional analytics workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:
