# What are meters in a counter group?

A **meter** is an individual measurement within a Trisul counter group that records a specific metric associated with a monitored entity.

In Trisul's counter-group architecture:

- The **counter group** defines what is being monitored.
- The **key** identifies the monitored entity.
- The **meter** defines what is being measured about that entity.

A useful way to think about a meter is that it answers the question:

> What exactly are we measuring?

Without meters, a counter group can identify monitored entities but cannot store meaningful measurements about them.

Meters provide the numerical data that powers analytics, reporting, alerting, visualization, and historical trend analysis.

## How meters work

A counter group consists of keys and meters.

The key identifies the monitored entity, while the meter stores measurements associated with that entity.

For example:

| Component | Example |
|------------|---------|
| Counter Group | Interfaces |
| Key | Ethernet1/1 |
| Meter | Inbound Bytes |
| Meter | Outbound Bytes |
| Meter | Inbound Packets |
| Meter | Outbound Packets |

In this example, the interface is the monitored entity and the meters track different measurements associated with that interface.

As activity is observed, meter values are continuously updated, allowing Trisul to build historical trends and operational analytics.

This design allows a single monitored entity to have multiple measurements without requiring separate monitoring structures for each metric.

---

## Why meters matter

Most monitored entities require more than one measurement.

For example, a network interface may need to track traffic volume, packet counts, error rates, and utilization. An application may require measurements related to sessions, transactions, response times, or activity levels.

Meters provide a structured way to store these measurements within the same monitoring framework.

Rather than treating every metric as a separate object, Trisul associates multiple measurements with the same monitored entity. This creates richer visibility while keeping analytics organized and scalable.

## Meters in network operations

Meters form the foundation of operational analytics.

Bandwidth monitoring relies on byte-based meters. DDoS investigations often focus on packet-rate and flow-count meters. Capacity planning depends on long-term utilization measurements. Application monitoring may rely on session counts, transaction volumes, or response-time metrics.

The usefulness of a meter depends on whether it measures something meaningful for the monitored entity. Selecting the right measurements is often more important than simply collecting a large number of metrics.

In practice, combining multiple meters usually provides a more complete understanding of network behavior than relying on a single measurement.

## Meters vs counter groups

| Category | Meter | Counter Group |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Purpose | Stores a specific measurement | Defines a monitoring structure |
| Function | Records metric values | Organizes keys and meters |
| Granularity | Individual metric | Collection of related measurements |
| Examples | Bytes, packets, flows, sessions | Interfaces, applications, hosts, ASNs |
| Scope | Single measurement type | Entire monitoring context |
| Best fit | Measuring activity | Organizing analytics data |

A counter group provides the context for monitoring, while meters provide the actual measurements.

Without counter groups, meter values lack meaning. Without meters, counter groups contain monitored entities but no measurable activity.

---

## What makes meters effective

The value of a meter depends on the relevance and consistency of the measurement it represents.

Meaningful meters support operational objectives such as troubleshooting, capacity planning, security investigations, service monitoring, and long-term trend analysis. Consistent meter definitions are equally important because changes in measurement logic can affect historical comparisons and trend accuracy.

Thresholds, baselines, Top-K calculations, and anomaly-detection systems all depend on reliable meter values to generate useful insights.

## In Trisul

Meters are a fundamental component of Trisul's counter-group architecture.

Every visualization, trend, threshold, report, Top-K calculation, and analytics workflow ultimately derives from meter values collected within counter groups.

Counter groups can contain one or many meters, allowing multiple measurements to be associated with the same monitored entity. Trisul's extensible architecture also allows custom applications and LUA-based extensions to define their own meters, enabling organizations to collect measurements tailored to their operational requirements.

Understanding meters is essential to understanding how Trisul stores, analyzes, and presents network intelligence.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is a meter in a counter group?

A meter is an individual measurement within a counter group that tracks a specific metric such as traffic volume, packet count, flow count, or application activity. Multiple meters can exist within the same counter group to provide different measurements for the same monitored entity.

### Can a counter group contain multiple meters?

Yes. A counter group typically contains multiple meters that measure different aspects of the same monitored entity. For example, a traffic counter group may include separate meters for bytes, packets, flows, and rates.

### Why are meters important for analytics?

Meters provide the numerical values used for trend analysis, alerting, reporting, Top-K calculations, and operational visibility. They are the measurements that make analytics possible.

### Can alerts be generated from meter values?

Yes. Meter values can be used by threshold-based and anomaly-based monitoring systems to identify unusual activity patterns, traffic spikes, performance issues, and operational events.

### Are meters limited to traffic measurements?

No. Meters can represent many types of measurements including packets, bytes, flows, sessions, events, response times, error counts, and custom analytics metrics.

### Why can a single key have multiple meters?

Because monitored entities often require multiple measurements. For example, an interface may track bytes, packets, errors, and utilization simultaneously, with each measurement represented by a separate meter.
