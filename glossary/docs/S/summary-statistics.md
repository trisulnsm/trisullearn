# What are summary statistics in network analytics?

**Summary statistics** are aggregate numerical measures used to describe the overall behavior of network and telemetry datasets, including totals, averages, counts, minimums, maximums, rates, and percentiles.

Summary statistics help reduce large volumes of telemetry and traffic data into smaller measurements that humans can interpret more efficiently.

They are widely used in enterprise, ISP, telecom, cloud, security-monitoring, and analytics environments for dashboards, reporting, anomaly detection, baseline analysis, and long-term traffic visibility.

## How summary statistics work

Analytics systems summarize large telemetry datasets by calculating aggregate values such as totals, averages, rates, counts, peaks, distributions, and percentiles.

These summaries help teams understand traffic behavior and long-term trends without inspecting every individual flow, session, or packet.

Summary statistics are especially useful for dashboards, utilization reporting, baseline analysis, anomaly detection, and historical traffic comparisons across large-scale environments.

Common telemetry sources include:

- NetFlow
- IPFIX
- sFlow
- SNMP telemetry
- Packet-analysis telemetry
- Session telemetry
- Interface counters
- Application telemetry

For example, a dashboard may summarize millions of flow records into average bandwidth usage, peak utilization, top applications, session counts, and 95th-percentile traffic measurements.

Summary statistics are commonly used to establish baselines for normal network behavior and detect deviations over time.

Percentiles are especially important because averages alone may hide short periods of severe congestion, latency spikes, or abnormal traffic behavior.

These measures provide a high-level analytical view without requiring direct inspection of every individual record.

## Summary statistics in network analytics

Summary statistics are commonly used for traffic reporting, dashboard visualization, baseline analysis, capacity planning, utilization tracking, trend analysis, anomaly detection, SLA reporting, QoS visibility, and historical traffic analysis.

Teams commonly investigate traffic spikes, bandwidth saturation, abnormal utilization patterns, long-term traffic growth, high-volume applications, congestion indicators, subscriber usage behavior, and service-performance trends.

Because large-scale telemetry environments can generate enormous amounts of raw data, summarized measurements help teams identify meaningful patterns and unusual behavior more quickly.

Historical summaries are especially useful for comparing long-term traffic behavior, identifying recurring anomalies, validating capacity trends, and analyzing changes in network usage over time.

## Common summary measures

| Measure | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Total | Overall measured quantity |
| Average | Typical observed value |
| Maximum | Highest observed measurement |
| Minimum | Lowest observed measurement |
| Count | Number of events or records |
| Rate | Activity level over time |
| Percentile | Distribution-based performance indicator |

Actual statistical measures depend on reporting goals, telemetry type, infrastructure scale, and analytical requirements.

## Benefits and challenges of summary statistics

Summary statistics simplify large datasets, improve trend visibility, support anomaly detection, and make dashboards and reports easier to interpret.

However, excessive aggregation may hide outliers, short-lived spikes, detailed traffic behavior, or brief performance anomalies that are only visible in raw telemetry.

Organizations commonly combine summary statistics, flow telemetry, packet analysis, historical traffic analysis, ranking workflows, and alert correlation to investigate unusual network behavior.

Correlating these telemetry sources helps teams determine whether unusual summary values represent genuine infrastructure problems, temporary traffic spikes, application changes, or abnormal communication behavior.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports summary-statistics workflows through flow telemetry analysis, aggregate counters, historical traffic visibility, dashboards, and traffic investigations.

Using NetFlow, IPFIX, packet-analysis workflows, interface telemetry, and traffic-analysis capabilities, operators can analyze summarized traffic and utilization behavior, generate aggregate views for hosts, applications, interfaces, and subscribers, correlate summary metrics with traffic anomalies and infrastructure conditions, support baseline analysis and historical reporting workflows, and investigate traffic behavior using both summarized and detailed telemetry views across enterprise, ISP, telecom, cloud, bandwidth-analysis, and analytics environments.

Additional analytics and traffic-investigation workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:
