# What is Network Security Monitoring?

**Network Security Monitoring (NSM)** is the collection and analysis of network telemetry to detect threats, investigate suspicious activity, and reconstruct security incidents using flow data, packet capture, and historical traffic analysis.

NSM combines flow telemetry, packet analysis, intrusion-detection visibility, and historical investigation workflows to help analysts identify abnormal behavior and investigate incidents across the network.

It is widely used in SOC, enterprise, ISP, telecom, cloud, and security-monitoring environments where organizations require continuous visibility into network activity, security events, and historical traffic behavior.

Unlike traditional network monitoring, which primarily focuses on operational health and availability, NSM is focused on threat detection, investigative visibility, incident reconstruction, and retrospective analysis.

## How Network Security Monitoring works

NSM environments typically combine flow telemetry, packet capture, IDS visibility, DNS activity, firewall logs, authentication records, and historical analytics so analysts can move from high-level threat detection into detailed forensic investigation quickly.

Flow telemetry such as NetFlow, IPFIX, and sFlow provides scalable visibility into communication patterns, traffic behavior, bandwidth activity, and host relationships across large environments.

Packet captures provide deeper forensic visibility because they preserve packet-level communications and, where available, payload data that can help analysts validate suspicious activity and reconstruct attack timelines.

Because retaining full packet captures continuously can become operationally expensive at scale, many NSM deployments combine long-term flow telemetry with selective packet retention and searchable historical analytics.

Operationally effective NSM depends heavily on telemetry correlation, searchable historical visibility, efficient indexing, accurate timestamps, and the ability to pivot quickly between alerts, flows, hosts, and packet evidence during investigations.

## Why NSM matters in network operations

NSM is operationally important because many attacks and security incidents are only fully understood after suspicious activity has already occurred.

Real-time alerts may indicate abnormal behavior, but investigators still need historical visibility to determine how systems communicated, what traffic moved across the network, which users or hosts were involved, and how the incident evolved over time.

This becomes especially important during malware investigations, lateral-movement analysis, incident response, insider-threat investigations, policy-violation analysis, command-and-control detection, and large-scale operational troubleshooting.

Historical traffic visibility is also critical because indicators of compromise are often discovered after the initial compromise occurs. Without retained telemetry and searchable historical analytics, investigators may not be able to reconstruct prior communication activity or determine the scope of an incident accurately.

As environments scale, NSM platforms must balance telemetry retention, storage cost, indexing performance, packet-capture depth, and investigative visibility across very large traffic environments.

This is why many organizations combine continuous flow monitoring, selective PCAP retention, IDS visibility, and searchable historical analytics instead of relying entirely on full packet capture retention.

## Core NSM telemetry sources

| Source | Operational visibility |
|---|---|
| Flow telemetry | Communication metadata, traffic patterns, and bandwidth activity |
| Packet capture (PCAP) | Packet-level forensic visibility and payload analysis |
| IDS alerts | Detection of suspicious signatures and abnormal behavior |
| DNS activity | Domain-resolution visibility and communication context |
| Firewall logs | Security-policy events and connection activity |
| Authentication records | User sessions, access events, and identity correlation |

Combining multiple telemetry sources improves investigative accuracy, historical reconstruction, and threat-correlation workflows.

## What makes NSM operationally effective

Operationally effective NSM depends heavily on scalable telemetry retention, searchable historical archives, efficient indexing, and reliable correlation between flows, packets, alerts, and log data.

Without searchable historical visibility, retrospective investigations become significantly more difficult because analysts may lack the telemetry needed to reconstruct communication activity accurately after a threat is discovered.

As traffic volumes increase, NSM workflows must also balance packet-retention depth, storage scalability, query performance, and long-term investigative visibility across distributed environments.

This makes flow telemetry, searchable historical analytics, and selective packet retention operationally important in large enterprise, ISP, telecom, and security-monitoring environments where retaining full packet captures continuously may not be operationally practical.

Per-flow packet indexing is especially valuable because it allows analysts to pivot directly from alerts, flows, or hosts into matching packet evidence without manually searching large packet archives.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports Network Security Monitoring through flow telemetry analysis, packet-capture integration, searchable historical analytics, and retrospective investigation workflows.

Using NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, J-Flow, packet analysis, historical traffic indexing, and per-flow packet correlation, Trisul helps analysts investigate suspicious traffic behavior, analyze host communications, reconstruct attack timelines, review subscriber activity, and correlate traffic events across large environments.

Trisul also allows analysts to pivot directly from flow analytics into matching packet evidence during investigations, improving investigative speed and historical visibility across both large-scale telemetry environments and detailed forensic workflows.

This becomes especially valuable during incident response, retroactive investigation, malware analysis, threat hunting, subscriber analysis, and long-term traffic-analysis workflows where historical visibility and searchable telemetry are operationally critical.

Additional deployment and capture workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:
