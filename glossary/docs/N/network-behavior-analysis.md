# What is Network Behavior Analysis?

**Network Behavior Analysis (NBA)** analyzes network traffic patterns and telemetry to identify anomalies, suspicious activity, infrastructure issues, and deviations from expected communication behavior.

NBA focuses on understanding how traffic normally behaves across hosts, applications, services, interfaces, and network segments, then identifying changes that may indicate attacks, misuse, operational problems, or abnormal activity.

Unlike systems that rely only on predefined signatures, NBA identifies unusual behavior by analyzing communication patterns, traffic baselines, protocol usage, and behavioral changes over time. Detection methods commonly include statistical analysis, heuristics, historical baselining, adaptive thresholds, and behavioral analytics.

NBA is widely used in enterprise, ISP, telecom, cloud, SD-WAN, and security-monitoring environments for anomaly detection, traffic investigations, infrastructure visibility, and behavioral traffic analysis.

## How Network Behavior Analysis works

NBA continuously analyzes network telemetry to establish expected communication and traffic patterns across the environment.

Telemetry sources commonly include NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, DNS telemetry, interface statistics, packet-analysis workflows, and historical traffic metrics. By comparing current traffic behavior against historical baselines, NBA systems can identify unusual deviations that may require investigation.

For example, an internal host suddenly communicating with large numbers of systems, generating unexpected outbound traffic, or using uncommon protocols may indicate malware activity, lateral movement, scanning behavior, or operational misconfiguration.

Depending on the implementation, NBA platforms may use statistical analysis, heuristic detection, threshold analysis, adaptive baselines, behavioral scoring, or machine-learning-assisted workflows to identify anomalies.

Not all NBA systems rely heavily on machine learning. In many operational environments, effective anomaly detection depends more on telemetry quality, historical visibility, and accurate behavioral correlation than on automated modeling alone.

When anomalies are identified, analysts commonly correlate the behavior with DNS activity, firewall events, subscriber mappings, packet analysis, or historical investigations to determine whether the activity is operationally significant, security-related, or simply an expected infrastructure change.

## Network Behavior Analysis in network operations

NBA helps operators identify communication patterns that deviate from normal network behavior.

Because NBA focuses on behavioral deviations rather than known signatures alone, it can help identify suspicious or abnormal activity even when no predefined attack signature exists. This makes behavioral analysis particularly useful for detecting unusual traffic behavior, internal reconnaissance activity, lateral movement, unexpected protocol usage, and infrastructure anomalies.

NBA is commonly used for traffic anomaly detection, DDoS investigations, port-scanning analysis, east-west traffic visibility, policy-violation investigations, and historical traffic analysis across large or distributed environments.

Behavioral visibility is especially valuable inside internal networks where attackers may use legitimate protocols or compromised credentials to move between systems without immediately triggering traditional signature-based alerts.

Historical analysis also helps analysts identify recurring anomalies, long-term behavioral shifts, changes in application usage patterns, and communication trends that may not be obvious through real-time monitoring alone.

## Common NBA detection categories

| Detection category | Description |
|---|---|
| Traffic anomalies | Sudden changes in traffic volume, flow rates, or utilization behavior |
| Communication anomalies | Unexpected host-to-host or service communication patterns |
| Protocol anomalies | Unusual protocol usage or traffic-distribution changes |
| Security-related anomalies | Behavior associated with scanning, floods, malware communication, or lateral movement |
| Infrastructure anomalies | Deviations associated with congestion, outages, routing issues, or instability |
| Policy-related anomalies | Traffic behavior inconsistent with segmentation or access policies |

Detection accuracy depends on telemetry quality, historical context, visibility coverage, and analysis methodology.

## Network Behavior Analysis challenges and best practices

Effective NBA depends on reliable telemetry collection, historical retention, accurate baselining, and meaningful traffic correlation across multiple telemetry sources.

Common operational challenges include incomplete visibility, dynamic cloud and application behavior, baseline drift over time, high telemetry volume, false-positive reduction, and correlating anomalies across distributed infrastructure.

Behavioral analysis alone does not guarantee threat identification, and unusual traffic patterns are not always malicious. Infrastructure changes, traffic bursts, backup activity, application updates, or routing changes may also generate anomalies that require investigation and contextual analysis.

Organizations commonly improve investigative accuracy by correlating NBA workflows with flow telemetry, DNS visibility, packet analysis, security investigations, subscriber-aware analysis, and historical traffic visibility.

Correlating behavioral anomalies with broader telemetry helps analysts determine whether deviations are associated with operational changes, misconfigurations, performance problems, or security-related activity.

Modern Network Detection and Response (NDR) platforms commonly incorporate NBA techniques as part of broader traffic-analysis and threat-investigation workflows.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports Network Behavior Analysis workflows through traffic-pattern analysis, flow telemetry analysis, historical traffic visibility, and anomaly-oriented investigation workflows.

Using NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, J-Flow, packet-analysis workflows, and historical traffic investigations, operators can analyze shifts in communication behavior, investigate unusual traffic patterns, correlate anomalies with hosts and applications, and perform historical analysis associated with suspicious or abnormal activity.

Trisul workflows commonly combine behavioral analysis, protocol visibility, traffic investigations, subscriber-aware analysis, and historical telemetry correlation to provide broader infrastructure and traffic visibility across enterprise, ISP, telecom, and large-scale network environments.

Additional traffic-analysis workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:

## Frequently asked questions

### What is Network Behavior Analysis?

Network Behavior Analysis (NBA) analyzes network traffic patterns and telemetry to identify anomalies, suspicious activity, infrastructure issues, and deviations from expected communication behavior.

### How does Network Behavior Analysis work?

NBA analyzes traffic telemetry over time to establish expected communication patterns and identify deviations associated with anomalies, infrastructure changes, or suspicious behavior. Detection methods may include statistical analysis, heuristics, historical baselining, and behavioral analytics.

### What anomalies does NBA detect?

NBA may identify unusual traffic volumes, unexpected communication patterns, abnormal protocol usage, scanning behavior, DDoS activity, lateral movement indicators, data-transfer anomalies, and deviations from established traffic behavior.

### What is the benefit of NBA over signature-based detection?

Unlike purely signature-based systems that depend on known attack patterns, NBA can help identify unusual or previously unseen behavior by analyzing deviations in communication and traffic patterns.

### Does Network Behavior Analysis rely entirely on machine learning?

No. Many NBA platforms use a combination of statistical analysis, heuristics, threshold analysis, historical baselining, and behavioral correlation. Machine learning may assist some workflows, but telemetry quality and historical visibility are often equally important for accurate analysis.

### What is the difference between NBA and signature-based detection?

Signature-based detection identifies known threats using predefined rules or attack patterns, while NBA focuses on identifying unusual or unexpected behavior that deviates from established traffic patterns.
