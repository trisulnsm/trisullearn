# What is an NGFW?

An **NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall)** combines traditional stateful inspection with application awareness, intrusion prevention, and advanced traffic inspection to provide deeper security visibility and policy enforcement.

Unlike conventional firewalls that primarily filter traffic using IP addresses, ports, and protocols, NGFWs inspect traffic at the application and content level to identify applications, enforce granular security policies, and detect suspicious or malicious activity across the network.

NGFWs are widely used in enterprise, cloud, telecom, and distributed network environments where organizations require stronger traffic visibility, segmentation enforcement, application-aware security controls, and integrated threat detection.

---

## How an NGFW works

NGFWs extend traditional stateful firewalls with deep packet inspection, application identification, intrusion prevention, user-aware policy enforcement, URL filtering, TLS inspection, and threat-intelligence-driven filtering.

Instead of relying only on network-layer information such as IP addresses and ports, NGFWs classify traffic using application behavior, user identity, protocol characteristics, content inspection, and security context.

This allows organizations to apply more granular security policies across modern applications, encrypted traffic, cloud services, remote-access environments, and east-west traffic flows inside internal networks.

Because NGFWs inspect traffic more deeply than traditional firewalls, inspection workloads can significantly increase CPU utilization, memory usage, latency, and throughput requirements, especially when TLS decryption and content inspection are enabled at scale.

---

## Why NGFWs matter in network operations

NGFWs are operationally important because modern applications, encrypted traffic, and distributed environments have reduced the effectiveness of traditional port-based filtering models.

Application-aware inspection allows operations and security teams to identify traffic more accurately, enforce segmentation policies, monitor application behavior, detect suspicious activity, and investigate security events using richer telemetry and traffic context.

This becomes especially important in environments involving:
- encrypted traffic inspection
- remote-access architectures
- cloud connectivity
- application segmentation
- east-west traffic visibility
- threat detection workflows

NGFW telemetry is also operationally valuable because it provides detailed visibility into allowed traffic, denied traffic, application usage, security-policy events, session activity, and inspected traffic behavior across the environment.

Organizations commonly integrate NGFW telemetry with SIEM platforms, traffic analytics systems, and historical monitoring platforms to improve correlation, investigation, and operational visibility across large environments.

## NGFW vs traditional firewall

| Capability | Traditional firewall | NGFW |
|---|---|---|
| Stateful inspection | Yes | Yes |
| Application awareness | Limited | Advanced |
| Intrusion prevention | External or limited | Commonly integrated |
| User-aware policies | Limited | Supported |
| TLS inspection | Rare or external | Commonly supported |
| Threat-intelligence integration | Minimal | Common |

NGFWs extend traditional firewall architectures with application-layer visibility, integrated security inspection, and richer telemetry analysis capabilities.

## What makes NGFW deployments operationally effective

Operationally effective NGFW deployments depend heavily on balancing inspection depth, throughput capacity, latency, TLS-decryption overhead, policy complexity, and telemetry visibility across the environment.

As inspection requirements increase, firewall infrastructure must process significantly larger workloads while still maintaining reliable traffic handling, application visibility, and policy-enforcement consistency.

Poorly optimized policies, excessive TLS inspection, or undersized hardware can introduce operational bottlenecks that affect throughput, session scalability, and traffic latency.

At the same time, NGFW telemetry becomes increasingly valuable because it provides application-aware visibility, security-event context, traffic-inspection metadata, and policy-enforcement analytics that can be correlated with broader network telemetry.

This makes scalable telemetry ingestion, historical analytics, and searchable traffic visibility operationally important in large enterprise, ISP, telecom, and hybrid-cloud environments.

## In Trisul

Trisul can ingest and analyze telemetry generated by NGFW platforms, including NetFlow, IPFIX, syslog-based security events, application visibility metadata, and traffic telemetry associated with inspected firewall activity.

Using flow analytics, historical traffic visibility, telemetry correlation, and application-aware traffic analysis, Trisul helps operations and security teams investigate traffic anomalies, analyze application behavior, review east-west and north-south traffic flows, correlate firewall events, and monitor utilization trends around NGFW infrastructure.

Trisul also helps organizations correlate NGFW telemetry with broader network traffic activity and historical analytics workflows across distributed environments.

This becomes especially valuable in environments where NGFW platforms generate large volumes of telemetry that must be correlated with network-wide visibility and long-term traffic analysis.

Additional traffic-analysis workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:
