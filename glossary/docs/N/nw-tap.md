# What is a network TAP?

A **network TAP (Test Access Point)** is a hardware device that passively copies traffic from a network link to monitoring systems, enabling packet analysis, troubleshooting, security monitoring, and traffic visibility without interfering with live traffic.

Network TAPs are commonly deployed between switches, routers, firewalls, WAN links, or other network devices to provide continuous packet visibility across monitored connections.

Unlike switch-based mirroring methods, TAPs copy traffic directly from the physical link itself. This allows monitoring platforms to observe network traffic independently of switch software, SPAN configurations, or forwarding behavior.

Because TAPs operate passively at the physical or link layer, they are widely used in enterprise, ISP, telecom, cloud, data-center, and security-monitoring environments where accurate packet visibility and monitoring reliability are important.

In many deployments, TAPs are also used for out-of-band monitoring workflows where packet visibility must occur without introducing additional traffic-processing overhead into production infrastructure.

## How a network TAP works

A network TAP is physically inserted inline between communicating devices and duplicates traffic flowing across the monitored connection toward one or more monitoring interfaces.

As packets traverse the link, the TAP creates independent copies of the traffic and forwards those copies to monitoring tools such as packet-capture systems, intrusion-detection platforms, forensic-analysis systems, or traffic-analysis appliances.

The original production traffic continues across the live network path without modification, while monitoring systems receive separate packet streams for analysis and visibility workflows.

Most TAPs operate transparently and do not participate in routing, switching, forwarding decisions, or application communication. This passive behavior is one reason TAPs are widely trusted for packet visibility and forensic monitoring workflows.

Depending on the deployment model, TAPs may support copper or fiber links, full-duplex traffic visibility, passive optical splitting, aggregation workflows, or high-speed monitoring environments.

In larger monitoring environments, TAP outputs are often connected to packet brokers or traffic-distribution systems that forward packet streams to multiple monitoring and security tools simultaneously.

## Network TAPs in network operations

Network TAPs are widely used in environments where reliable packet visibility is more important than simple traffic monitoring alone.

Because TAPs copy traffic directly from the physical link instead of relying on switch software, they generally provide more accurate and consistent packet visibility under high-throughput conditions. SPAN sessions may drop mirrored packets during congestion, oversubscription, or switch resource contention, while passive TAPs are designed to maintain consistent monitoring visibility even during heavy traffic conditions.

This distinction is especially important during troubleshooting, forensic analysis, intrusion detection, performance investigations, and security monitoring workflows where packet completeness may affect investigative accuracy.

Operational teams commonly connect TAP outputs to packet-capture platforms, IDS and IPS systems, network-performance-monitoring tools, forensic-analysis environments, traffic-analysis systems, and security-monitoring platforms that require reliable packet visibility.

For example, during a security investigation, a TAP may provide full packet visibility to intrusion-detection systems and packet-capture platforms without depending on switch mirroring configurations that could drop packets under load.

TAP-based monitoring is commonly used for packet capture, traffic recording, protocol analysis, WAN troubleshooting, incident-response workflows, forensic investigations, performance analysis, and monitoring high-speed network links across enterprise, ISP, telecom, and data-center environments.

## TAP vs SPAN

| Method | Characteristics |
|---|---|
| TAP | Passively copies traffic directly from the physical link |
| SPAN | Mirrors traffic using switch-based port mirroring |
| TAP visibility | Generally provides more consistent packet visibility under load |
| SPAN visibility | May experience packet drops or mirroring limitations during congestion |
| TAP deployment | Requires physical inline installation |
| SPAN deployment | Configured logically through switch software |

Both approaches are widely used depending on visibility requirements, infrastructure constraints, deployment flexibility, and monitoring objectives.

## Network TAP challenges and best practices

Effective TAP deployments depend on correct physical placement, reliable monitoring interfaces, sufficient packet-processing capacity, and visibility into monitored traffic flows.

Common deployment challenges include high-speed packet capture requirements, monitoring-port oversubscription, fiber and copper compatibility, physical deployment complexity, distributed monitoring environments, packet-storage scalability, and encrypted-traffic visibility limitations.

Organizations commonly improve monitoring visibility by combining TAP-based packet capture with flow telemetry, historical traffic analysis, DNS visibility, security telemetry, and broader traffic-analysis workflows.

Correlating packet visibility with flow telemetry and historical traffic analysis helps operators investigate both packet-level activity and broader traffic behavior across network environments.

As traffic volumes increase and environments become more distributed, TAP deployments increasingly work alongside packet brokers, traffic-distribution systems, and telemetry-correlation platforms to support scalable monitoring architectures.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports TAP-based monitoring workflows through packet-analysis workflows, flow telemetry analysis, historical traffic visibility, and traffic-investigation capabilities.

Using TAP-fed packet streams together with NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, and historical traffic analysis workflows, operators can analyze packet-level and flow-level traffic behavior, investigate performance anomalies, correlate packet activity with broader traffic patterns, and perform historical traffic investigations across distributed environments.

Trisul workflows commonly combine packet analysis, flow analysis, historical traffic visibility, telemetry correlation, and investigation workflows to provide broader infrastructure and traffic visibility across enterprise, ISP, telecom, cloud, and security-monitoring environments.

Additional deployment and packet-analysis workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:

## Frequently asked questions

### What is a network TAP?

A network TAP is a hardware device that passively copies traffic from a network link to monitoring systems, enabling packet analysis, troubleshooting, security monitoring, and traffic visibility without interfering with live traffic.

### Why use a network TAP?

A network TAP provides reliable passive visibility into network traffic for packet capture, troubleshooting, security monitoring, performance analysis, and forensic investigations without depending on switch-based mirroring.

### How is a TAP different from SPAN?

A TAP copies traffic directly from the physical network link, while SPAN mirrors traffic using switch-based software configurations. TAPs generally provide more complete and consistent packet visibility under high-load conditions.

### What is a network TAP used for?

Network TAPs are used for packet capture, traffic visibility, network troubleshooting, security monitoring, performance analysis, forensic investigations, and out-of-band monitoring workflows.

### Why are TAPs preferred for packet analysis and security monitoring?

TAPs generally provide more reliable packet visibility because they passively copy traffic directly from the physical link rather than relying on switch-based mirroring configurations that may drop packets during congestion or high-load conditions.

### Can a network TAP affect production traffic?

Most passive TAPs are designed to operate transparently without modifying production traffic or participating in routing and switching behavior. Monitoring systems receive copied packet streams independently from the live network path.
