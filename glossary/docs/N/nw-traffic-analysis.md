# What is network traffic analysis?

**Network traffic analysis (NTA)** examines packets, flow telemetry, and communication behavior to understand how traffic moves across the network, identify abnormal activity, and improve operational visibility.

It helps operations and security teams understand which hosts, applications, services, protocols, and communication patterns are responsible for observed network behavior across enterprise, ISP, cloud, and distributed environments.

Unlike infrastructure monitoring, which primarily measures device health and interface status, traffic analysis explains how the network is actually being used and how communication behavior changes over time.

Infrastructure counters may show that utilization increased, but traffic analysis reveals which applications, hosts, conversations, or traffic patterns caused the change and how communication behavior evolved across the environment.

## How network traffic analysis works

Traffic-analysis platforms correlate flow telemetry, packet captures, DNS activity, protocol metadata, and infrastructure telemetry to reconstruct communication behavior and identify how traffic moves across the network.

Flow telemetry such as NetFlow, IPFIX, and sFlow provides scalable visibility into conversations, traffic patterns, bandwidth usage, application behavior, and long-term communication trends across large environments.

Packet analysis provides deeper protocol and session visibility when detailed forensic analysis, payload inspection, or low-level troubleshooting is required.

Because retaining full packet captures continuously can become operationally expensive at scale, many environments combine long-term flow analytics with selective packet retention and searchable historical traffic analysis.

Operationally effective traffic analysis depends heavily on telemetry correlation, traffic classification, historical visibility, scalable analytics, and the ability to identify meaningful behavioral changes across very large traffic environments.

## Why network traffic analysis matters in network operations

Network traffic analysis is operationally important because many operational and security problems become visible first in traffic behavior rather than infrastructure alarms alone.

Applications may become slow, traffic paths may shift unexpectedly, east-west communication may increase abnormally, bandwidth consumption may spike, or suspicious communication patterns may emerge even while infrastructure devices continue to appear operational.

Operations teams therefore use traffic analysis to investigate bandwidth consumption, identify abnormal communication behavior, analyze east-west traffic patterns, troubleshoot application issues, detect anomalies, investigate suspicious activity, and understand how traffic behavior changes across the environment over time.

Historical traffic visibility is especially important because many operational issues develop gradually or are only discovered after suspicious behavior has already occurred. Retained telemetry allows teams to compare current traffic behavior against historical baselines and reconstruct prior communication activity during troubleshooting and investigations.

As environments scale, effective traffic analysis increasingly depends on correlating traffic telemetry, infrastructure metrics, application visibility, historical analytics, and behavioral patterns together rather than analyzing isolated metrics independently.

## Common traffic analysis outputs

| Output | Operational visibility |
|---|---|
| Top talkers | Highest bandwidth consumers across hosts or applications |
| Conversations | Communication relationships between systems |
| Application visibility | Active protocols, services, and applications |
| Traffic trends | Behavioral and utilization changes over time |
| Bandwidth analysis | Link and service utilization patterns |
| Anomaly indicators | Unusual traffic spikes or communication behavior |

These analytics help operations teams move from raw telemetry into actionable operational visibility.

## What makes traffic analysis operationally effective

Flow telemetry provides scalable visibility across large environments without requiring full packet capture everywhere, while packet analysis adds deeper investigative visibility when detailed protocol analysis is necessary.

Historical traffic retention improves troubleshooting, behavioral analysis, incident investigations, and capacity planning because teams can compare current traffic behavior against historical communication patterns and operational baselines.

Effective traffic analysis also depends heavily on telemetry enrichment and classification so traffic can be associated accurately with applications, hosts, services, protocols, subscribers, or operational roles across the environment.

As traffic volumes increase, analytics systems must balance telemetry retention, indexing performance, query scalability, investigative depth, and long-term operational visibility across distributed infrastructures.

This is why many organizations combine flow analytics and selective packet analysis together to balance scalability, retention efficiency, and investigative depth.

## In Trisul

Trisul is built around large-scale network traffic analysis using flow telemetry, packet analysis, historical analytics, traffic-behavior monitoring, telemetry correlation, and long-term operational visibility across distributed environments.

Using NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, packet analysis, and historical traffic telemetry, Trisul helps operations and security teams investigate bandwidth consumption, analyze application activity, monitor east-west traffic behavior, identify top talkers and conversations, investigate suspicious traffic patterns, and correlate infrastructure activity with actual network communication behavior.

Trisul’s flow-centric analytics architecture provides both real-time traffic visibility and long-term behavioral analysis across enterprise, ISP, telecom, broadband, cloud, and large-scale operational environments.

This becomes especially valuable in environments where operational visibility depends heavily on understanding how traffic behavior evolves over time rather than relying only on infrastructure-health metrics.

Additional deployment and traffic-analysis workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:
