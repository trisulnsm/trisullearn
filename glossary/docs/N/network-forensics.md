# What is network forensics?

**Network forensics** is the collection, preservation, and analysis of network traffic and telemetry to investigate security incidents, reconstruct historical activity, and support operational or compliance investigations.

It is a specialized area of digital forensics focused on understanding how systems communicated across the network, what activity occurred, when it occurred, and which hosts, users, applications, or services were involved.

Network forensics commonly uses packet captures (PCAP), flow telemetry such as NetFlow and IPFIX, firewall logs, DNS activity, authentication records, proxy metadata, and other historical telemetry sources to reconstruct network behavior surrounding an incident.

Unlike real-time monitoring, network forensics is primarily focused on retrospective analysis and historical reconstruction after suspicious activity, operational failures, policy violations, or security incidents occur.

## How network forensics works

Network forensic workflows combine traffic telemetry, packet analysis, log correlation, and historical investigation techniques to reconstruct network activity across time.

Packet captures provide deep visibility because they preserve packet-level communications and, where available, payload data. Flow telemetry provides summarized communication metadata that scales more efficiently for long-term retention and large environments.

Because retaining full packet captures continuously can become operationally expensive at scale, many organizations combine selective PCAP retention with long-term flow telemetry and searchable historical analytics.

Investigators often correlate packet captures, flow records, DNS activity, authentication logs, firewall events, proxy metadata, and security telemetry together to reconstruct communication timelines, identify abnormal behavior, and investigate indicators of compromise across distributed environments.

Operationally effective network forensics depends heavily on searchable historical visibility, efficient indexing, telemetry retention, timestamp accuracy, and scalable correlation across multiple telemetry sources.

## Why network forensics matters in network operations

Network forensics is operationally important because many security incidents and operational problems are only fully understood after the event has already occurred.

Real-time monitoring may identify suspicious behavior, but forensic analysis helps investigators determine how systems communicated, what traffic moved across the network, which users or hosts were involved, and how an incident evolved over time.

This becomes especially important during security investigations, malware analysis, insider-threat investigations, incident response workflows, policy-violation analysis, compliance investigations, and large-scale operational troubleshooting.

Historical visibility is critical because indicators of compromise are often discovered after an incident begins. Without retained telemetry and searchable historical traffic analysis, investigators may not be able to reconstruct past communication activity or validate the scope of an incident accurately.

As environments scale, organizations must balance packet retention depth, telemetry storage cost, indexing performance, and investigative visibility across increasingly large traffic volumes.

This is why many large environments combine continuous flow monitoring, selective packet retention, historical telemetry archives, and searchable analytics platforms together instead of relying exclusively on full packet capture retention.

## Network forensics data sources

| Source | Operational visibility |
|---|---|
| PCAP | Full packet-level visibility including headers and payloads where available |
| Flow telemetry | Summarized communication metadata and traffic statistics |
| Firewall logs | Connection events and security-policy activity |
| DNS logs | Domain lookups and name-resolution activity |
| Authentication logs | User access activity and session information |
| Proxy and web logs | Application and web-access metadata |

Combining multiple telemetry sources improves investigative accuracy, timeline reconstruction, and incident correlation.

## What makes network forensics operationally effective

Operationally effective network forensics depends heavily on scalable telemetry retention, efficient indexing, searchable historical archives, and reliable correlation between packet, flow, and log data sources.

Without searchable historical visibility, retrospective investigations become significantly more difficult because investigators may lack the telemetry needed to reconstruct communication activity accurately after an incident is discovered.

As traffic volumes increase, forensic workflows must also balance packet-retention depth, storage scalability, query performance, and long-term investigative visibility across distributed environments.

This makes flow telemetry, searchable historical analytics, and selective packet retention operationally important in large enterprise, ISP, telecom, and security-monitoring environments where retaining full packet captures continuously may not be operationally practical.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports network-forensics workflows through flow telemetry analysis, historical traffic retention, packet-capture integration, searchable traffic analytics, and retrospective investigation capabilities.

Using NetFlow, IPFIX, packet analysis, historical telemetry indexing, and searchable traffic analytics, Trisul helps operations and security teams investigate abnormal traffic behavior, analyze host communications, reconstruct historical activity, review subscriber behavior, and correlate traffic events across large environments.

Trisul also allows analysts to pivot between flow analytics and packet-level evidence during investigations, improving investigative visibility across both large-scale telemetry environments and detailed packet-analysis workflows.

This becomes especially valuable during incident response, retroactive investigation, subscriber analysis, malware investigation, operational troubleshooting, and long-term traffic-analysis workflows where historical visibility is operationally critical.

Additional capture and traffic-analysis workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:
