# What is network observability?

**Network observability** is the ability to understand network behavior by collecting, correlating, and analyzing telemetry such as flows, packets, metrics, logs, and contextual data across network environments.

Unlike basic monitoring or visibility alone, observability focuses on understanding how systems, applications, services, and infrastructure behave over time and how multiple telemetry signals relate to each other during investigations or troubleshooting workflows.

Traditional monitoring systems often focused on isolated metrics, device health, or threshold-based alerts. However, modern distributed environments generate large volumes of interconnected telemetry across networks, cloud infrastructure, applications, services, and security systems. Network observability emerged to help operators correlate these signals and investigate complex infrastructure behavior more effectively.

In enterprise, ISP, telecom, cloud, SD-WAN, and distributed infrastructure environments, observability workflows help teams investigate performance issues, traffic anomalies, infrastructure changes, application behavior, and security-related events using correlated telemetry and historical analysis.

## How network observability works

Network observability combines telemetry from multiple sources to build broader context around infrastructure and traffic behavior.

Observability platforms commonly correlate flow telemetry, packet analysis, interface metrics, DNS activity, logs, routing telemetry, and infrastructure metadata to help operators understand how traffic, applications, systems, and services interact across the environment.

A typical workflow begins with telemetry collection from network devices, infrastructure platforms, applications, and traffic-analysis systems. The collected telemetry is then normalized, indexed, enriched, and correlated using timestamps, hosts, interfaces, sessions, routing behavior, traffic flows, or application context.

Operators use this correlated telemetry to investigate infrastructure conditions, troubleshoot performance issues, identify traffic anomalies, analyze application behavior, and perform root-cause analysis across distributed environments.

For example, if users experience intermittent application latency, observability workflows may correlate interface metrics, DNS behavior, routing changes, flow telemetry, and packet analysis to determine whether the issue originated from congestion, infrastructure instability, application behavior, or external connectivity problems.

Depending on deployment requirements, observability workflows may combine real-time monitoring with historical investigations and long-term telemetry retention to support troubleshooting and infrastructure analysis over time.

## Network observability in network operations

In operational environments, network observability helps teams understand how infrastructure behavior, traffic patterns, and application activity are related across distributed systems.

Because modern environments often include encrypted traffic, hybrid-cloud infrastructure, dynamic application behavior, multi-vendor telemetry, and rapidly changing workloads, isolated monitoring tools are frequently insufficient for troubleshooting complex problems.

Observability workflows help operators move beyond isolated metrics and alerts by correlating telemetry across hosts, applications, interfaces, services, and time windows.

These workflows are commonly used for:

- Root-cause analysis
- Traffic-pattern analysis
- Performance troubleshooting
- WAN and cloud visibility
- Infrastructure monitoring
- Security investigations
- Application-behavior analysis
- Historical traffic investigations
- Operational anomaly analysis

Correlated observability workflows can also reduce troubleshooting time by helping operators identify relationships between telemetry sources more quickly during investigations.

Historical visibility is especially important because intermittent failures, application instability, routing changes, or traffic anomalies may only become visible when operators correlate telemetry across different systems and time periods.

## Visibility vs observability

| Concept | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Visibility | Access to telemetry or infrastructure data |
| Observability | Correlated analysis used to understand system and network behavior |
| Monitoring | Continuous tracking of infrastructure conditions, metrics, or traffic activity |
| Root-cause analysis | Investigation workflows used to explain problems, anomalies, or failures |

Observability commonly builds on monitoring and visibility by adding telemetry correlation, historical analysis, and investigation-oriented workflows.

## Network observability challenges and best practices

Effective observability depends on broad telemetry coverage, reliable correlation workflows, historical retention, scalable analytics, and meaningful infrastructure context.

Common challenges include incomplete telemetry visibility, distributed infrastructure complexity, telemetry normalization across multiple vendors, encrypted-traffic visibility limitations, correlation accuracy, and large-scale telemetry retention.

Organizations commonly improve observability by combining flow telemetry, packet analysis, DNS visibility, infrastructure metrics, logs, routing telemetry, and historical traffic analysis into unified investigation workflows.

Correlating telemetry across hosts, sessions, interfaces, applications, and infrastructure layers helps operators investigate complex conditions more effectively than isolated telemetry sources alone.

As environments become more distributed and application-driven, observability increasingly depends on historical analysis, telemetry enrichment, and contextual correlation rather than standalone monitoring metrics.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports network observability workflows through flow telemetry analysis, packet-analysis workflows, DNS visibility, historical traffic analysis, and multi-source telemetry correlation.

Using NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, packet analysis, interface telemetry, and historical visibility workflows, operators can analyze traffic behavior across distributed environments, correlate flows and packets with DNS and infrastructure telemetry, investigate performance anomalies, and perform historical traffic investigations across multiple telemetry sources.

Trisul workflows commonly combine flow analysis, packet analysis, protocol visibility, historical traffic analysis, and investigation workflows to provide broader infrastructure and traffic visibility across enterprise, ISP, telecom, cloud, and large-scale network environments.

Additional traffic-analysis workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:
