# What is NetFlow sampling?

**NetFlow sampling** selects a subset of packets for flow processing and export instead of analyzing every packet. It reduces CPU, memory, and export bandwidth overhead on routers and switches while preserving useful visibility into traffic patterns and bandwidth utilization at high network speeds.

A sampling ratio of **1:1000** means approximately one out of every thousand packets is selected for flow generation and analysis.

NetFlow sampling is widely used in high-speed enterprise, ISP, carrier, and backbone environments where exporting every flow may overwhelm forwarding hardware, routing CPUs, collectors, or long-term storage systems.

---

## How NetFlow sampling works

Sampling may be deterministic, where every *n*-th packet is selected, or probabilistic, where packets are chosen randomly according to a configured sampling ratio.

After sampling occurs, exporters typically scale packet and byte counters using the configured sampling ratio so collectors can estimate overall traffic volumes and utilization patterns accurately.

For example, at a 1:1000 sampling rate, observed counters are multiplied by 1000 to estimate total traffic levels across the interface or device.

Operationally, sampled telemetry generally preserves large traffic trends, utilization behavior, and long-duration flows reasonably well. However, small flows, bursty traffic, short-lived sessions, and low-volume security events may become underrepresented or disappear entirely depending on the configured sampling ratio.

This creates an operational tradeoff between scalability and visibility precision.

---

## Why NetFlow sampling matters in network operations

NetFlow sampling is operationally important because modern high-speed networks can generate enormous amounts of telemetry.

Without sampling, exporting every flow on multi-gigabit or high-density interfaces can consume significant CPU resources, memory, export bandwidth, and storage capacity across routers, switches, and collectors.

Sampling reduces this operational overhead while still preserving useful visibility into bandwidth trends, backbone utilization, application behavior, and large traffic patterns.

This makes sampled telemetry especially useful for:
- capacity planning
- backbone visibility
- ISP-scale monitoring
- traffic trending
- utilization analysis
- long-term operational analytics

At the same time, aggressive sampling reduces visibility into small flows and short-duration traffic activity, which can affect detailed forensic investigations, anomaly analysis, and low-volume security-event detection.

Operational teams must therefore balance visibility accuracy against scalability, export overhead, collector performance, and telemetry-retention requirements.

## Sampling methods comparison

| Method | Description | Visibility precision | Operational overhead |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deterministic sampling | Every *n*-th packet is selected | Predictable but may miss traffic patterns | Moderate |
| Random sampling | Packets selected probabilistically | Better statistical distribution | Moderate |
| Full flow export | All flows exported without sampling | Highest visibility and precision | High |

Different sampling approaches create different tradeoffs involving scalability, statistical accuracy, telemetry visibility, and operational cost.

## What makes sampled telemetry operationally useful

Operationally effective sampled-flow analysis depends heavily on collectors correctly interpreting configured sampling ratios and scaling telemetry accurately.

When collectors account for sampling properly, sampled telemetry remains highly effective for bandwidth analysis, traffic trending, utilization monitoring, backbone visibility, and long-term operational analytics.

However, excessive sampling can reduce the reliability of detailed traffic investigations because small sessions, intermittent traffic bursts, and low-volume activity may not appear consistently in exported telemetry.

As network speeds increase, sampled telemetry therefore becomes a practical compromise between visibility precision and scalable flow analytics.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports sampled flow analysis through NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, and high-speed telemetry ingestion workflows.

Using sampling metadata included in exported flow records, Trisul applies the configured sampling information to maintain accurate traffic calculations, utilization metrics, and long-term bandwidth analytics across sampled environments.

This allows operators to analyze high-speed traffic environments where full flow export may not be operationally practical due to export overhead, storage requirements, or infrastructure scale.

Even with sampling enabled, Trisul remains highly effective for traffic trend analysis, backbone visibility, utilization monitoring, and ISP-scale operational analytics involving large traffic volumes and long-term telemetry visibility.

Additional flow-analysis workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:

### What is NetFlow sampling?

NetFlow sampling selects a subset of packets for flow export instead of processing every packet. It reduces CPU and export overhead while preserving useful visibility into traffic patterns and bandwidth utilization at high speeds.

### Why use NetFlow sampling?

NetFlow sampling is used on high-speed networks where exporting every flow would consume excessive CPU, memory, or export bandwidth.

### How does sampling affect accuracy?

Sampling preserves large traffic patterns and utilization trends reasonably well, but reduces visibility into small, bursty, or short-lived flows.

### What is the difference between sampled and full NetFlow?

Full NetFlow exports all observed flows for maximum visibility, while sampled NetFlow exports only selected packets or flows to reduce processing and export overhead.
