# What is NBAD?

**Network Behavior Anomaly Detection (NBAD)** is a monitoring approach that identifies unusual network activity by learning what normal network behavior looks like and detecting deviations from that behavior.

Unlike signature-based systems that look for known patterns, NBAD focuses on behavioral changes. Its goal is not to identify known threats, but to highlight activity that differs from established network expectations.

A useful way to think about NBAD is that it continuously asks a simple question:

> **"Does this activity look normal for this network?"**

If the answer is no, the activity is highlighted for further investigation.

This makes NBAD valuable for identifying operational issues, performance problems, misconfigurations, emerging threats, and previously unseen behaviors that may not match any predefined detection rule.

---

## How NBAD works

NBAD begins by establishing a baseline of normal network behavior.

A baseline represents the network's expected behavior across traffic patterns, communication relationships, application usage, infrastructure activity, and operational trends.

As new telemetry and traffic data are collected, current behavior is continuously compared against these expectations. When activity deviates significantly from normal behavior, the system identifies the event as anomalous and generates alerts or investigative visibility.

Unlike systems that rely entirely on predefined rules, NBAD adapts its understanding of the environment over time while remaining sensitive to meaningful behavioral changes.

The effectiveness of NBAD depends heavily on the quality of these baselines because anomaly detection is fundamentally based on understanding what "normal" looks like.

---

## Why NBAD matters

Traditional monitoring is highly effective at identifying known conditions.

However, many operational issues and security events begin as subtle behavioral changes rather than obvious failures.

An application may suddenly communicate with new destinations. A service may begin generating unusual traffic patterns. A host may exhibit activity that has never previously been observed.

These events may not trigger predefined signatures or exceed static thresholds, yet they can represent important operational or security changes.

NBAD helps organizations identify these deviations by focusing on behavior rather than predefined indicators.

---

## NBAD in network operations

NBAD is widely used in enterprise, service provider, and security-monitoring environments where understanding normal behavior is as important as detecting failures.

Operations teams use NBAD to identify:

* Unexpected traffic growth
* Unusual protocol activity
* Emerging congestion
* Service degradation
* Routing or communication changes

Security teams use anomaly detection to investigate behaviors that differ from established communication patterns and historical baselines.

Because modern networks generate enormous volumes of telemetry, behavioral analysis helps operators focus attention on activity that is unusual enough to warrant investigation.

## NBAD vs signature-based detection

| Category                         | NBAD                                             | Signature-Based Detection        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Detection method                 | Behavioral deviation analysis                    | Pattern and signature matching   |
| Focus                            | Unusual activity                                 | Known events and indicators      |
| Visibility into unknown activity | High                                             | Limited                          |
| Baseline dependency              | Required                                         | Not required                     |
| Operational requirement          | Historical baselines and tuning                  | Signature maintenance            |
| Best fit                         | Behavioral monitoring and anomaly identification | Known threat and event detection |

Signature-based systems answer the question:

> Have we seen this pattern before?

NBAD answers a different question:

> Have we seen behavior like this before?

This allows NBAD to identify activity that differs from expected behavior even when no predefined signature exists.

The two approaches are complementary and are often used together.

## NBAD vs threshold monitoring

Threshold monitoring identifies activity that exceeds predefined limits.

Examples include:

* Interface utilization above 90%
* Packet loss above a specified threshold
* Traffic volume exceeding a configured limit

NBAD takes a different approach.

Rather than relying entirely on fixed limits, it evaluates activity against historical behavioral baselines. An activity level that is normal for one network may be highly unusual for another.

This allows anomaly detection systems to identify behavioral changes that fixed thresholds may miss.

---

## What makes NBAD effective

Baseline quality is the most important factor in anomaly detection.

Poorly maintained baselines can generate excessive false positives and reduce confidence in detection results.

Context is equally important because not every anomaly represents a problem.

Scheduled maintenance, software deployments, traffic migrations, business growth, and seasonal usage patterns can all generate legitimate behavioral changes.

An anomaly is not automatically an incident.

**NBAD identifies what is unusual, not necessarily what is malicious.**

For this reason, anomaly detection should be paired with investigative workflows and operational context. Detecting unusual behavior is only the first step. Operators must still determine whether the anomaly represents a legitimate change or a condition requiring action.

## In Trisul

NBAD is directly relevant to Trisul and aligns with the platform's Network Behavior Anomaly Detection capabilities.

Trisul uses historical network behavior as context for identifying meaningful deviations from expected activity across traffic volumes, flows, protocols, applications, and other monitored metrics.

By combining anomaly detection with flow analytics, historical visibility, counter groups, trackers, and Top-K analysis, Trisul provides the operational context needed to investigate abnormal network behavior.

Rather than simply identifying that something changed, these capabilities help operators understand how behavior changed, when it changed, and whether further investigation is required.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is NBAD?

Network Behavior Anomaly Detection (NBAD) is a monitoring technique that identifies deviations from normal network behavior by comparing current activity against historical baselines and expected traffic patterns.

### What types of anomalies can NBAD identify?

NBAD can identify unusual traffic volumes, unexpected communication patterns, abnormal protocol usage, traffic spikes, scanning activity, and other behavioral deviations that differ from established network baselines.

### How is NBAD different from signature-based detection?

Signature-based detection identifies known patterns and predefined indicators, while NBAD focuses on behavioral deviations regardless of whether a known signature exists.

### Can NBAD generate false positives?

Yes. Legitimate operational changes such as application rollouts, traffic growth, maintenance activities, or seasonal usage patterns can appear anomalous if baselines are not properly maintained and tuned.

### Does NBAD replace traditional monitoring?

No. NBAD complements traditional monitoring by highlighting unusual behavior that may warrant investigation. It is most effective when used alongside traffic analytics, alerting systems, and operational monitoring workflows.

### How is NBAD different from threshold monitoring?

Threshold monitoring uses fixed limits, while NBAD evaluates activity against historical behavioral baselines. This allows NBAD to identify unusual behavior even when predefined thresholds are not exceeded.

### Does an anomaly always indicate a security incident?

No. Anomalies indicate deviations from expected behavior. Some anomalies may represent legitimate operational changes, while others may require investigation. Additional context is required before determining whether action is necessary.
