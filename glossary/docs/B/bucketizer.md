# What is a Bucketizer?

A **Bucketizer** is a data-processing mechanism that groups values into predefined ranges, known as buckets, to help analysts understand how measurements are distributed.

Unlike counters that focus on totals, Bucketizers focus on distributions. Rather than answering:

> How much activity occurred?

they answer:

> How is that activity distributed?

This distinction is important because averages and aggregate metrics often hide important behavioral details.

A useful way to think about a Bucketizer is:

> **Counters reveal the size of activity.**
>
> **Bucketizers reveal the shape of activity.**

This makes Bucketizers valuable for analytics, troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and anomaly detection.

## Why Bucketizers matter

Large datasets often contain patterns that are difficult to identify through averages alone.

For example, an application may show an average response time of 20 milliseconds, which appears healthy at first glance.

However, the distribution may reveal that:

- Most requests complete in 5 milliseconds
- A smaller group experiences 150-millisecond delays

The average hides this behavior.

A Bucketizer exposes it by showing how measurements are distributed across ranges.

This ability to reveal distributions makes Bucketizers useful for identifying performance issues, traffic characteristics, outliers, and unusual operational conditions.

---

## How a Bucketizer works

A Bucketizer receives measurements and assigns each value to a predefined range.

For example, flow durations may be grouped into buckets such as:

| Bucket | Duration Range |
|----------|---------------|
| Bucket 1 | 0–1 second |
| Bucket 2 | 1–10 seconds |
| Bucket 3 | 10–60 seconds |
| Bucket 4 | Greater than 60 seconds |

As new measurements arrive, the Bucketizer updates the count associated with the appropriate bucket.

The resulting distribution provides a summarized view of how values are spread across the monitored environment.

Instead of analyzing millions of individual records, operators can quickly understand dominant patterns and identify unusual concentrations of activity.

---

## Bucketizers in network operations

Many operational questions are fundamentally questions about distributions.

Examples include:

- Are most flows short-lived or long-lived?
- Are latency values concentrated in expected ranges?
- Are packet sizes distributed normally?
- Are session durations changing over time?

Different measurements can be bucketized, but the goal remains the same:

> Understand how values are distributed rather than relying solely on totals or averages.

This perspective often reveals behavioral changes that aggregate metrics alone cannot expose.

## Bucketizer vs counter

| Category | Bucketizer | Counter |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Primary purpose | Group values into ranges | Measure activity levels |
| Output | Distribution of values | Numeric totals |
| Analytical focus | Spread and composition | Volume and utilization |
| Typical examples | Latency ranges, duration ranges, flow-size ranges | Bytes, packets, flows |
| Processing model | Categorization into buckets | Metric accumulation |
| Best fit | Distribution analysis and behavioral visibility | Traffic measurement and monitoring |

Counters reveal:

- How much traffic occurred
- How many packets were observed
- How many flows were recorded

Bucketizers reveal:

- How flow sizes are distributed
- How latency values are distributed
- How session durations are distributed

Both perspectives are important and often complement one another.

---

## Bucketizers and histogram analysis

Bucketized data is commonly visualized using histograms.

Each bucket represents a range of values, while the associated count shows how many measurements fall into that range.

Histograms make it easier to identify clusters, outliers, skewed distributions, and unusual behavioral patterns that may not be visible through summary statistics alone.

For this reason, Bucketizers often serve as the foundation for distribution-based analytics and visualization.

---

## What makes Bucketizers effective

The usefulness of a Bucketizer depends heavily on bucket design.

Buckets that are too broad may hide important details, while buckets that are too narrow can make analysis unnecessarily complex.

The chosen measurement should align with the operational objective. Latency buckets may be valuable for performance monitoring, while flow-duration buckets may provide greater insight into application behavior.

Consistency is equally important. Stable bucket definitions allow meaningful comparisons across different time periods and improve long-term trend analysis.

## In Trisul

Bucketizers are directly relevant to Trisul's analytics framework and are used to organize measurements into meaningful ranges for analysis and visualization.

Rather than focusing solely on aggregate metrics, Bucketized views help reveal patterns, concentrations, and outliers that may otherwise remain hidden.

These distributions complement counters, cardinality analytics, Top-K analysis, historical reporting, and investigation workflows by providing additional insight into how network activity is distributed across monitored traffic and telemetry.
