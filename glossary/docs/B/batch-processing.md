# What is batch processing?

Batch processing is the execution of data processing tasks in grouped runs rather than continuously in real time. It collects data over a period and then processes it together at scheduled intervals, which is efficient for large‑scale or non‑urgent analysis.

## How batch processing works

Data is accumulated over minutes, hours, or days and then processed in a single “batch” run, often at a fixed time or when a threshold amount of data has been collected. This allows systems to analyze large volumes efficiently while keeping resource usage predictable.

Because the work is delayed, the results are not immediate. Batch processing is therefore better suited to summaries and reports than to real‑time alerts or live dashboards.

---

## Batch processing in operations

Batch processing is often used for monthly or weekly reports, historical analysis, ranking, and archive‑based analytics. It is useful when teams want a broad, aggregated view instead of instant visibility.

It can also reduce system load during peak hours. Heavy analysis can be scheduled for off‑hours, avoiding conflicts with real‑time monitoring and user‑facing workloads.

## Common batch uses

| Use             | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| Reporting       | Summarize past activity into tables or charts |
| Ranking         | Generate top‑N lists (for example, top talkers) |
| Archive analysis| Review long‑retained data for trends or incidents |
| Statistics      | Compute aggregate measures such as averages, counts, or totals |

## What makes batch processing useful

Batch processing is useful because it is efficient and scalable for large‑scale analysis. It allows deeper, more resource‑intensive computation without the pressure of immediate response.

Its main tradeoff is delay. If the result is needed right away—for example, for live troubleshooting or alerting—batch processing may not be the right choice, and real‑time or near‑real‑time methods are preferred.

## In Trisul

Trisul can support batch‑style analysis for reports, summaries, rankings, and historical traffic review.  
By running batch jobs over archived or historical flow data, Trisul can generate usage reports, long‑term trend summaries, and rank‑based views without impacting real‑time collection and monitoring performance.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is batch processing?

Batch processing is the execution of data processing tasks in grouped runs rather than continuously in real time. It collects data over a period and then processes it together at scheduled intervals.

### Why is batch processing used?

Batch processing is used to handle large amounts of data efficiently when immediate results are not required. It is especially useful for background, non‑urgent analysis and scheduled jobs.

### What is batch processing used for?

Batch processing is used for reporting, summarization, archival analysis, and scheduled analytics. Typical applications include monthly reports, top‑talker rankings, and aggregate‑statistic jobs.

### How is batch processing different from real-time processing?

Batch processing works on accumulated data at intervals, while real‑time processing handles events as they happen. Batch processing trades immediate feedback for efficiency and scalability on large datasets.
