# What is flow deduplication?

**Flow deduplication** is the process of identifying and handling duplicate flow records generated when multiple exporters observe and export telemetry for the same network communication. In multi‑path, multi‑exporter, or multi‑vantage‑point environments, a single conversation can appear multiple times in the telemetry stream. If treated naïvely, this inflates traffic volumes and skews statistics; deduplication normalizes the view by correlating or merging these records into a consistent representation while preserving context where needed.

---

## How flow deduplication works

Flow deduplication begins as flow records arrive at the collector. The system compares key fields such as **source/destination IPs**, **ports**, **protocol**, **start/end timestamps**, **flow duration**, and **exporter metadata** to detect records that describe the same underlying communication. Within a configurable correlation window, the platform can then apply logic such as **discarding duplicates**, **merging counters**, **grouping legs**, or **creating a correlated view** while optionally retaining the original records. The exact behavior depends on whether the goal is clean reporting (e.g., bandwidth accounting) or detailed forensic access (e.g., per‑link visibility).

---

## Why duplicate flow records occur

Duplicates arise naturally in many architectures:  
- **Multiple routers or interfaces** monitor the same path, each exporting the same flow.  
- **Bidirectional or multi‑hop routing** causes the same session to be visible at several points.  
- **Overlay and underlay monitoring**, packet‑based probes, and device‑exported NetFlow/IPFIX all observe the same traffic.  
Even small differences—such as different interface IDs, timestamps, DSCP, or sampling ratios—can cause the same flow to appear multiple times, making correlation non‑trivial.

---

## Flow deduplication in network operations

In **NOC** environments, deduplication is critical for accurate **bandwidth reporting**, **interface utilization**, and **capacity‑planning dashboards**, because it prevents double‑ or triple‑counting of traffic. In **SOC** workflows, teams often keep **original flow legs** for investigative context—such as per‑AS, per‑link, or per‑interface detail—while using deduplicated or correlated views for high‑level statistics and anomaly detection. The trade‑off is between clean, normalized metrics and the investigative value of seeing how traffic appears at each monitoring point.

---

## Flow deduplication vs flow stitching

**Flow deduplication** handles overlapping telemetry from **multiple exporters or monitoring points** that see the same conversation. **Flow stitching** combines **forward and reverse‑direction** records for the same session into a single bidirectional flow, improving visibility into full conversations rather than per‑direction slices. Both can coexist: a platform might stitch unidirectional exports, then deduplicate across multiple routers or interfaces, giving a clean, conversation‑level view that still reflects the underlying topology.

---

## Flow deduplication vs packet deduplication

**Flow deduplication** operates on **summarized telemetry** (flow records) at the network‑communication layer, eliminating duplicate telemetry from overlapping exporters. **Packet deduplication** works at the **packet‑level**, removing duplicate packet‑capture observations that occur when the same packets are mirrored to multiple TAPs or SPAN ports. The two address different duplication scenarios: one in flow‑based traffic analytics, the other in packet‑forensic systems.

---

## Operational considerations

Deduplication must account for **exporter‑timing skew**, **sampling differences**, **clock drift**, **multi‑path routing**, and varying **interface contexts**. If logic is too aggressive, it can hide per‑link behavior valuable to security or topology‑aware engineers. Many deployments therefore **retain original records**, **generate correlated views**, and **provide deduplicated summaries** separately, so operators can toggle between clean reporting and detailed forensic visibility. Storage and query performance must be tuned accordingly, since keeping multiple representations of the same traffic increases data volume.

## How Trisul handles flow deduplication

Trisul supports flow‑deduplication through **flow‑leg correlation** and the **MergeMultipleSources** configuration, letting operators normalize traffic visibility across overlapping exporters while preserving underlying telemetry. By default it can correlate flow legs from multiple routers or interfaces, unify counters, and expose both **original records** and **correlated/merged views** depending on the deployment mode. This is useful in ISP, multi‑site enterprise, and datacenter environments where the same flows are visible at multiple vantage points. Trisul combines this with **historical traffic analysis**, **Explore Flows**, **Flow Taggers**, and **Interface Tracking** so that operators can move between clean traffic‑summaries and raw, multi‑source telemetry as needed.

## Frequently asked questions

### Why does flow deduplication sometimes increase storage rather than reduce it?

Some platforms retain both original flow legs and deduplicated views simultaneously to preserve investigative context while also supporting normalized reporting. This can increase storage requirements because both representations remain available for different operational workflows.

### How does a collector identify duplicate flow records?

Collectors commonly compare fields such as source and destination addresses, ports, protocols, timestamps, and exporter metadata within a configured correlation window to identify records representing the same communication. Deduplication logic varies by platform and telemetry architecture.

### Does flow deduplication affect security investigations?

Yes. Aggressive deduplication may reduce visibility into per‑device or per‑interface telemetry that can be useful during investigations. Some operational workflows therefore preserve original records alongside correlated or deduplicated views.

### What is the difference between flow deduplication and packet deduplication?

Flow deduplication operates on summarized telemetry records representing communications, while packet deduplication operates on individual packets observed multiple times within packet‑capture environments. The two processes address different forms of monitoring duplication.

### How does Trisul support flow‑deduplication workflows?

Trisul supports flow‑deduplication workflows through flow‑leg correlation, MergeMultipleSources options, historical traffic analysis, and operational traffic‑visibility capabilities that help operators analyze overlapping telemetry from multiple exporters.
