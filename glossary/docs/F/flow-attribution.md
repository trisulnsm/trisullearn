# What is flow attribution?

**Flow attribution** is the process of associating network flows with specific users, hosts, applications, services, interfaces, or network segments using flow telemetry and contextual metadata. Raw flow records typically contain only IP addresses, ports, protocols, and traffic volumes; attribution adds operational meaning by tying that traffic to business or infrastructure entities such as “Finance‑DB server,” “User‑John‑Desktop,” or “Tenant‑A‑workload.” This is essential for understanding who did what, troubleshooting effectively, and enforcing policies in environments with dynamic addressing or NAT.

---

## How flow attribution works

Flow attribution correlates flow telemetry (NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, etc.) with external context. Sources include **DHCP logs**, **NAT translation tables**, **authentication systems (RADIUS, LDAP, SSO)**, **DNS records**, **VLAN/VRF mappings**, **CMDB**, **cloud‑instance metadata**, and **application‑identification feeds**. The system matches timestamps and IP/port combinations to map a flow to a host, user, application, tenant, or segment. Depending on architecture, this can happen in real time, during historical investigations, or as part of reporting pipelines. The quality of attribution depends on telemetry coverage, metadata freshness, and precise time synchronization.

## Flow attribution in operations

In **security operations**, attribution turns a suspicious flow into an actionable incident: which host, user, and app were involved, and how it fits into an attack timeline. SOC teams use it for incident response, insider‑threat hunting, malware communication analysis, and data‑exfiltration tracing. In **network operations**, attribution improves capacity planning, service‑level visibility, and tenant‑based reporting by tying traffic to applications, business units, or customers. In **ISP and multi‑tenant environments**, it supports subscriber‑level analytics, policy enforcement, and audit‑ready records, especially when many hosts share public IPs via NAT or CGNAT.

## Common flow‑attribution targets

| Target                    | Operational meaning |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Host / device             | Physical or virtual endpoint generating traffic        |
| User / identity           | Authenticated person or account                      |
| Application / service     | Software or platform causing the communication       |
| Interface                 | Path or ingress/egress point in the network          |
| VLAN / VRF / segment      | Network or security zone context                     |
| Tenant / business unit    | Organizational or customer ownership context         |
| Cloud workload / pod      | Virtualized or orchestrated system                   |
| Service / microservice    | Logical service boundary in distributed architecture  |

In practice, multiple labels may apply to a single flow, and operators often use them to filter or slice traffic by business impact.

## Flow attribution and NAT environments

NAT and PAT obscure the original host behind a shared public IP, so flow attribution without NAT logs is incomplete. In CGNAT or carrier‑grade NAT, operators must correlate flows with translation tables and AAA/DHCP records to recover internal IP‑to‑user mappings. This is critical for lawful‑interception‑style workflows, incident reconstruction, and abuse investigations; if translation logs are missing or poorly retained, attribution accuracy degrades sharply.

---

## Flow attribution in cloud environments

Cloud and virtualized environments are dynamic, with ephemeral instances, elastic IPs, and frequent autoscaling. Attribution here relies on **instance metadata (cloud tags, instance IDs)**, **Kubernetes labels or namespaces**, **container IDs**, and **virtual‑network mappings**. Tools that enrich flow data with these labels let operators see traffic tied to “Production‑Web,” “CI‑CD‑Pipelines,” or “QA‑Database” rather than just IP addresses, improving both operations and security visibility.

---

## Operational considerations

Flow attribution faces several constraints: **gaps in telemetry**, **inconsistent metadata**, **clock drift**, and **high‑cardinality environments** where thousands of short‑lived workloads create noise. NAT, DHCP rotation, and dynamic IP assignment increase the risk of misattribution if logs are not retained or synchronized. Best practices include tight timestamp alignment, long‑enough retention for source logs, and automated correlation rules that can be validated and tuned. When attribution is inaccurate, investigations and reporting may draw wrong conclusions.

## How Trisul handles flow attribution

Trisul supports flow attribution by enriching raw telemetry with operational context instead of producing identity data itself. Using **NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow**, and related telemetry, it can associate traffic with **interfaces, hosts, applications, and segments** via **Flow Taggers**, **Interface Tracking**, and host‑oriented views. Operators then use **Explore Flows**, historical analysis, and anomaly detection to investigate traffic that is already tagged with business‑relevant labels. Trisul does not act as a AAA or identity system but provides the analytics layer that correlates flow‑level behavior with the metadata your network and cloud infrastructure emit.
