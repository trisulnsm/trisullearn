# What is a flow exporter?

**A flow exporter** is a network device, software probe, or telemetry component that observes traffic, generates flow records, and exports summarized flow telemetry to collectors using protocols such as **NetFlow, IPFIX, or sFlow**. It is the source of flow‑based visibility in a network, turning packets into 5‑tuple metadata (source/destination IP, port, protocol, timestamps, packet/byte counts) that downstream analytics platforms use for trending, troubleshooting, and security investigations. Flow exporters are typically routers, switches, firewalls, virtual appliances, or software probes that sit on the data path or monitoring points.

---

## How a flow exporter works

A flow exporter first observes traffic on interfaces or SPAN‑enabled paths, grouping packets into conversations based on the flow keys it tracks. It then accumulates counters and timing metadata for each session until a flow expires (via active or inactive timeouts). Finally, it exports that record—often in **NetFlow v9, IPFIX, or sFlow** format—to one or more collectors, using UDP‑based transport for scalability. Modern exporters can include extended metadata such as **VLAN IDs, MPLS labels, BGP attributes, DSCP, and application identifiers**, making the telemetry richer for analytics and policy use.

---

## Flow exporters in network operations

In **enterprise and NOC** environments, flow exporters enable **bandwidth trending, interface‑utilization analysis, capacity‑planning, and application‑visibility** by exposing what hosts talk to each other and how much they send. **SOC** teams rely on exporter telemetry for **lateral‑movement detection, threat hunting, incident‑reconstruction, and data‑exfiltration analysis**, because flows show communication patterns even without payloads. **ISPs and carriers** deploy thousands of exporters to feed centralized analytics with **per‑ASN, per‑subscriber, and peering‑level visibility** for traffic‑engineering, capacity, and regulatory‑style reporting.

---

## Flow exporter vs flow collector

A **flow exporter** sits in the network and is responsible for **observing traffic and generating telemetry**; it usually keeps only a small in‑memory cache of flows. A **flow collector** sits elsewhere (often centralized) and **receives, parses, stores, and analyzes** the exported records. Exporters define *what* is measured; collectors define *how long* it is kept and *how* it is queried. Together they form the complete telemetry pipeline: the exporter is the source, and the collector is the destination and analytics engine.

---

## Hardware exporters vs software probes

**Hardware exporters** live on routers, switches, and firewalls, deriving flows from forwarding‑path observations; they provide broad, topology‑wide coverage but may be limited by hardware and vendor‑specific telemetry options. **Software probes** run on dedicated servers or virtual machines, observing traffic from TAPs, SPAN ports, or packet brokers; they can offer richer or unsampled telemetry and more flexible tagging, at the cost of additional infrastructure. Many networks use both: hardware exporters for wide‑area coverage and software probes for high‑fidelity monitoring at key chokepoints.

---

## Export protocols and telemetry models

Most exporters use **NetFlow, IPFIX, or sFlow** to ship telemetry. **NetFlow v9** and **IPFIX** are template‑based, letting the exporter define which fields are sent and enabling flexible, extensible telemetry across enterprise and ISP environments. **sFlow** is sampling‑centric, typically exporting a small fraction of packets and interface counters, optimized for high‑scale switching and datacenter scenarios. The choice of protocol affects sampling behavior, metadata depth, and compatibility with analytics platforms, so operators must match exporters to their collectors.

---

## Export reliability and operational considerations

Because flow export is typically UDP‑based, exporters can **drop, delay, or lose records** under load without explicit retransmission. CPU‑bound exporters, limited flow‑cache sizes, and heavy traffic volumes all contribute to telemetry gaps. Operators must monitor **exporter‑side counters, flow‑cache health, and packet‑/flow‑loss metrics** as well as **collector‑ingestion rates** to validate that telemetry is representative. They should also harden exporters against overload and oversized flows, so that monitoring itself does not degrade network performance.

## How Trisul handles flow exporters

Trisul ingests **NetFlow, IPFIX, and sFlow** telemetry from a wide range of exporters, including routers, switches, firewalls, and virtual appliances. It auto‑discovers **exporters and interfaces**, normalizes telemetry into a common model, and enriches flows with **Flow Taggers, Interface Tracking, and host‑level context**. Operators can then use **historical traffic analysis**, **Explore Flows**, and **Top‑K analytics** to pivot from device‑level exports to detailed traffic investigations. For environments where native exporters are sparse or oversampled, Trisul can also generate flow records from packet‑based observations, giving operators an independent source of flows alongside device‑exported telemetry.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is the difference between a flow exporter and a flow collector?

A flow exporter generates and exports flow telemetry from observed traffic, while a flow collector receives, parses, stores, and analyzes that telemetry. Exporters are typically routers, switches, probes, or software agents, whereas collectors provide centralized traffic‑analysis and operational‑visibility workflows.

### Can a single flow exporter send to multiple collectors?

Yes. Many exporter implementations support multiple export destinations so the same telemetry can be sent simultaneously to different monitoring, analytics, or security platforms. The exact configuration depends on the exporter implementation and telemetry protocol.

### What export protocol should a flow exporter use?

IPFIX is the IETF‑standardized flow‑export protocol and is commonly recommended for modern deployments because of its flexible template‑based design. NetFlow v9 remains widely deployed and operationally similar, while sFlow uses a different sampling‑oriented telemetry model. Protocol choice depends on exporter support, telemetry requirements, scalability goals, and operational workflows.

### What happens when a flow exporter drops records?

If exporters become overloaded or telemetry paths experience congestion, flow records may be delayed or lost. Many export mechanisms use UDP transport, which does not provide retransmission guarantees. Monitoring exporter health, telemetry statistics, and collector‑ingestion metrics helps operators validate telemetry completeness.

### How does Trisul support flow‑export workflows?

Trisul supports flow‑export workflows through NetFlow, IPFIX, and sFlow ingestion, auto‑discovery of exporters, historical traffic analysis, Explore Flows workflows, and packet‑derived flow generation capabilities for environments requiring software‑based telemetry generation.
