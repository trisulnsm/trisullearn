# What is a flow tracker?

A **flow tracker** is a monitoring and analysis workflow that follows the behavior of selected network flows, hosts, conversations, or traffic patterns over time to support troubleshooting, operational visibility, and security investigations. Instead of scanning the entire telemetry dataset repeatedly, a flow tracker “pins” a specific host, conversation, or behavior and then continuously or retrospectively analyzes all matching traffic across time windows, directions, and peers. This makes it easier to understand how a communication evolves, whether it is stable or anomalous, and how it interacts with other systems.

---

## How flow tracking works

Flow tracking starts when an analyst selects something to watch, such as a **host IP**, **application**, **conversation**, or **behavioral pattern** (for example, traffic tagged as “high‑risk” or “beaconing”). The analytics platform then retrieves all matching flow records, correlates them over time, and exposes a timeline of activity, including **bytes**, **packets**, **peers**, **protocols**, and **directionality**. Typical steps are: **selection → correlation → historical tracking → behavioral review → investigation pivot**. The exact visibility depends on retention depth, telemetry completeness, and exporter placement, but the core idea is to keep one focal point tied to all relevant traffic rather than recomputing queries from scratch each time.

---

## Flow tracking in network operations

In **NOC** environments, flow tracking is used for **troubleshooting**, **capacity investigations**, **congestion analysis**, and **application‑visibility validation**, letting operators watch how traffic for a specific service or link changes over time. In **SOC** workflows, it becomes a core tool for **threat hunting**, **beaconing analysis**, **lateral‑movement investigation**, and **incident‑response timeline reconstruction**, because teams can follow suspicious endpoints or destinations across hours, days, or even weeks of telemetry. In **ISP and carrier** settings, tracking supports **subscriber‑behavior analysis**, **service‑validation**, and **long‑term capacity planning**, where understanding how a given traffic pattern evolves is more important than just viewing today’s snapshot.

---

## What flow tracking can show

A flow tracker can expose several dimensions of behavior:

| Visibility type | Example insight |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Bytes and packets | Whether traffic is growing or shrinking over time |
| Communication peers | Which systems the tracked host talks to and how that set changes |
| Directionality | Whether traffic is mostly inbound, outbound, or bidirectional |
| Timing patterns | Regular beacons, bursts, or idle periods |
| Historical trends | Long‑term drift in usage or risk level |
| Session duration | Persistent sessions vs short‑lived bursts |

Flow tracking gains even more value when combined with **application‑level context**, **host‑metadata**, **geographic tags**, **threat‑intel tags**, and **baselines**, so that operators can reason not just about volume and destinations but about who, why, and how traffic behaves.

---

## Flow tracker vs flow tagger

A **flow tracker** focuses on **following behavior over time**, such as tracking a host, a conversation, or a pattern through historical telemetry, primarily for **investigations and analysis**. A **flow tagger** focuses on **enriching flow records with contextual labels** (for example, by country, service, or threat‑status) so that future queries and tracking become easier to compose. In practice, the two workflows are complementary: tags help you **select what to track**, and the tracker then **maintains and visualizes the behavior** of those tagged entities over time.

---

## Operational considerations

Flow tracking works best when telemetry is **retained long enough**, **indexed efficiently**, and **reasonably complete**. Heavily **sampled flows**, **asymmetric routing**, or **short retention windows** can all limit the usefulness of tracking by introducing gaps or distortions in the timeline. Query performance, **high‑cardinality traffic**, and **cross‑device correlation** are also important, since analysts may track large or noisy entities. Organizations improve tracking by ensuring **consistent exporter policies**, **centralized analytics**, **metadata enrichment**, and **carefully planned retention**, so that “following a flow” yields a trustworthy, fine‑grained behavior picture.

## How Trisul handles flow tracker

Trisul supports flow‑tracking workflows by combining **historical traffic analysis**, **Explore Flows**, **host‑ and application‑level visibility**, **Top‑K analytics**, and **Flow Taggers** into a unified investigative interface. Operators can start from a host, tag, alert, or application and then **track all related flows over time**, drill into individual conversations, and pivot between dashboards and detailed records. This is useful for **troubleshooting**, **anomaly investigation**, and **incident‑response**, where the platform’s **scalable, metadata‑driven visibility** lets analysts follow behavioral patterns across large enterprise, ISP, or cloud‑scale environments without switching tools or reconstructing context manually.
