# What is flow analysis?

**Flow analysis** is the practice of examining network flow records to understand traffic patterns, identify top talkers, detect anomalies, and investigate operational or security issues using metadata instead of full packet payloads. A “flow” is typically defined by a 5‑tuple (source and destination IP, source and destination port, protocol), plus timestamps, packet counts, and byte counts, representing a communication session between two endpoints. Because flow data summarizes behavior rather than recording every packet, it enables long‑term retention and large‑scale analysis across the whole network.

---

## What flow analysis examines

Flow analysis focuses on communication behavior across hosts, interfaces, applications, protocols, and time. Analysts commonly look at traffic volume, top talkers, protocol or application mix, conversation patterns, interface utilization, and traffic‑directionality. By enriching flows with tags, threat intelligence, geolocation, or ASN information, operators can query traffic using business‑oriented context (for example, “all traffic to critical‑app‑zone” or “all east‑west traffic between web and DB tiers”) rather than raw IP addresses. Time‑based analysis is especially important, as baselines and anomalies only emerge when traffic is viewed across hours, days, or weeks.

## Flow analysis in network operations

In **NOC** operations, flow analysis drives capacity planning, bandwidth trending, and congestion investigations. Teams use it to pinpoint saturated links, high‑volume applications, and traffic‑growth patterns. In **SOC** workflows, it supports threat hunting, lateral‑movement analysis, and historical incident reconstruction by showing which hosts talked to each other, when, and how much data moved. For **ISP** and carrier environments, flow analysis enables peering analysis, per‑ASN or per‑prefix visibility, and traffic‑engineering decisions. In all these roles, flow analysis gives a “big‑picture” view of traffic that is hard to see with packet‑level tools alone.

---

## Flow analysis vs packet analysis

Flow analysis deals with communication metadata: who talks to whom, when, and how much; packet analysis dives into the individual packets and, where possible, their payloads. Flow records are compact and easy to store for long periods, so flow analysis scales well and supports weeks‑ or months‑long retention. Packet‑level data is much richer for protocol‑level validation and deep inspection, but it is expensive to store and usually limited to short capture windows. In practice, teams use flow analysis to scope and prioritize investigations, then drop to packet analysis only when they need to inspect protocol mechanics or content.

## Common flow technologies

Several standards and vendor‑specific formats carry flow telemetry:

| Technology | Description |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| NetFlow   | Cisco‑originated flow‑export protocol                     |
| IPFIX     | IETF‑standardized flow export (often used generically)    |
| sFlow     | Packet‑sampling and flow‑monitoring protocol              |
| J‑Flow    | Juniper‑specific flow‑export format                       |
| NetStream | Huawei‑specific flow export                               |

These differ in sampling model, metadata depth, and scale, but all feed the same basic flow‑analysis logic: aggregating and correlating 5‑tuples and related counts over time.

## What affects flow analysis accuracy

Flow‑analysis quality depends heavily on telemetry design and placement. Sampled flows (for example, 1 in N packets) can miss short‑lived connections or underestimate low‑volume traffic. Gaps in exporter coverage—certain links or devices not exporting flows—or lossy collectors can create blind spots. Asymmetric routing, where traffic flows differ on ingress vs egress paths, may skew visibility unless both sides export flows. Retention limits and slow or overloaded collectors further degrade what can be queried effectively. Understanding these limitations is as important as the tooling when interpreting results.

## How Trisul handles flow analysis

Trisul treats flow analysis as a core operational capability. It ingests **NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow**, and related telemetry from routers, switches, firewalls, and gateways, then stores and indexes flows for long‑term analysis. Features such as **Historical traffic analysis**, **Explore Flows**, **Interface Tracking**, and **Top‑K analytics** let operators quickly pivot from dashboards to detailed investigations, whether the goal is capacity planning, anomaly hunting, or incident response. **Flow Taggers** enrich records with business‑ or security‑relevant context, and anomaly detection surfaces suspicious patterns automatically. Trisul is not a packet‑based DPI engine but provides the scalable, metadata‑driven layer that powers flow‑centric monitoring across enterprise, ISP, and cloud environments.

## Frequently asked questions

### What questions can flow analysis answer?

Flow analysis helps answer which systems communicated, when communication occurred, how much traffic was exchanged, which protocols were used, and how traffic behavior changed over time. It supports operational visibility, anomaly detection, traffic trending, and investigation workflows without requiring payload inspection.

### How is flow analysis different from packet analysis?

Flow analysis examines summarized network communication metadata such as the 5‑tuple, timestamps, packet counts, and byte counts, while packet analysis examines individual packets and payload content when available. Flow analysis typically provides broader retention and scalability, whereas packet analysis provides deeper protocol visibility.

### What use cases does flow analysis support?

Flow analysis supports bandwidth trending, capacity planning, top‑talker analysis, anomaly detection, security investigations, traffic engineering, peering analysis, historical traffic investigations, and operational troubleshooting across enterprise, datacenter, ISP, and cloud environments.

### What affects flow analysis accuracy?

Flow analysis accuracy may be affected by sampled telemetry, incomplete exporter coverage, telemetry loss, exporter configuration differences, asymmetric routing visibility, retention limits, and collector performance constraints.

### How does Trisul support flow analysis workflows?

Trisul supports flow analysis workflows through flow ingestion, historical traffic analysis, Explore Flows investigation workflows, Interface Tracking, Top‑K analytics, Flow Taggers, and operational traffic‑visibility capabilities using NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, and related telemetry.
