# What is peering?

**Peering** is a direct traffic-exchange arrangement where autonomous networks exchange traffic without routing it through a third-party transit provider.

Peering allows participating networks to exchange traffic more efficiently by shortening routing paths, reducing dependency on upstream transit providers, lowering latency, and improving traffic delivery between networks.

Peering relationships commonly exist between ISPs, telecom providers, cloud platforms, CDNs, content providers, and large enterprise networks.

Large content providers and CDNs commonly use peering to deliver streaming, cloud, and application traffic more efficiently to ISPs and end users.

## How peering works

Peering is commonly established through Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) or private interconnects where networks exchange routes using BGP and send traffic directly between each other.

Unlike transit providers, which offer broader internet reachability, peering networks exchange traffic directly only for their own customers, services, or routing policies.

Direct traffic exchange can reduce latency, shorten routing paths, lower upstream transit costs, and improve traffic-delivery efficiency across internet-facing infrastructure.

Peering often allows local or regional traffic to remain within a geographic region instead of traversing distant upstream transit networks.

For example, without peering, traffic between two regional ISPs might traverse upstream transit providers in another city or country before reaching its destination, increasing latency and transit costs.

Depending on the agreement, peering may be settlement-free or involve commercial arrangements such as paid peering.

## Peering in network operations

Peering is widely used for ISP traffic exchange, CDN delivery, cloud connectivity, regional internet optimization, low-latency application delivery, and transit-cost reduction.

Operators commonly monitor interconnect utilization, ASN traffic distribution, routing changes, congestion, latency behavior, and traffic growth across peering links.

Because internet traffic patterns can change rapidly, peering visibility is important for understanding how routing decisions and external traffic sources affect infrastructure performance.

For example, streaming platforms or cloud services may suddenly increase traffic volumes across specific peering links during peak usage periods or large-scale events.

Peering analysis is also important for capacity planning, routing optimization, traffic engineering, and identifying imbalanced traffic relationships between networks.

## Common peering types

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Public peering | Traffic exchange through an Internet Exchange Point (IXP) |
| Private peering | Dedicated direct interconnect between networks |
| Settlement-free peering | Traffic exchanged without direct financial settlement |
| Paid peering | Commercial interconnection arrangement between networks |

The peering model used depends on traffic volume, geographic presence, routing policy, and business relationships between participating networks.

## Challenges in peering

Effective peering depends on reliable routing visibility, scalable interconnect capacity, accurate traffic analysis, and stable BGP policy management.

Common challenges include interconnect congestion, routing-policy complexity, traffic-ratio disputes, BGP instability, changing traffic patterns, geographic traffic shifts, and coordinating traffic exchange across multiple providers.

Organizations commonly improve peering visibility by combining flow telemetry, ASN analysis, BGP visibility, interface monitoring, and historical traffic analysis.

Correlating these telemetry sources helps operators understand how routing decisions, peer relationships, and traffic distribution affect latency, congestion, and interconnect performance.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports peering-analysis workflows through ASN visibility, flow telemetry analysis, BGP-related visibility, interface monitoring, and historical traffic investigations.

Using NetFlow, IPFIX, ASN analytics, interface telemetry, and historical traffic analysis workflows, operators can analyze traffic exchanged with external peers, monitor interconnect utilization, investigate ASN-specific traffic behavior, analyze routing-related trends, and perform historical investigations across ISP, telecom, cloud, internet-edge, and distributed network environments.

Additional ASN-analysis and flow-analysis workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:

## Frequently asked questions

### What is peering?

Peering is a direct traffic-exchange arrangement where autonomous networks exchange traffic without routing it through a third-party transit provider. Peering improves routing efficiency, reduces transit dependency, and optimizes internet traffic delivery.

### How does peering work?

Peering works by connecting networks through Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) or private interconnects where they exchange routing information using BGP and send traffic directly between each other.

### Why is peering important?

Peering is important because it can reduce latency, improve routing efficiency, lower transit costs, and keep regional traffic closer to its destination instead of routing it through distant upstream providers.

### What is peering analysis?

Peering analysis examines traffic exchanged between networks, including ASN relationships, routing behavior, traffic distribution, interconnect utilization, and peering performance.

### What is the difference between peering and transit?

Transit providers offer broader internet connectivity by carrying traffic to external networks, while peering allows networks to exchange traffic directly with each other without relying entirely on upstream transit paths.

### Why are Internet Exchange Points important?

IXPs help networks exchange traffic locally and efficiently, reducing latency, improving routing efficiency, and minimizing dependency on long-distance upstream transit providers.
