# What is packet analysis?

**Packet analysis** captures and inspects network packets to investigate traffic behavior, protocol activity, communication issues, and security-related events using packet-level visibility and PCAP data.

By analyzing packet headers, protocol fields, timing information, and communication patterns, packet analysis helps operators understand how systems and applications interact across the network.

Because packet analysis inspects actual network traffic instead of summarized telemetry alone, it provides detailed visibility into communication behavior that may not be visible through flow records or infrastructure metrics.

Packet analysis is widely used in enterprise, ISP, telecom, cloud, security-monitoring, and troubleshooting environments where detailed traffic visibility is required.

## How packet analysis works

Packet analysis captures traffic from monitored network links and inspects packet behavior, protocol activity, timing information, and communication patterns.

Traffic is commonly collected using network TAPs, SPAN or mirror ports, virtual traffic mirroring, or embedded packet-capture workflows.

Captured traffic is then analyzed using tools such as Wireshark, tcpdump, or packet-analysis platforms that support filtering, protocol decoding, statistical analysis, and PCAP investigations.

Packet analysis is often used when flow telemetry or infrastructure metrics do not provide enough detail to explain communication failures, retransmissions, DNS issues, application slowdowns, or protocol-related problems.

For example, a flow record may show that communication occurred between two systems, while packet analysis can reveal retransmissions, TLS handshake failures, DNS delays, malformed packets, or application-level errors affecting that communication.

Depending on the environment and encryption visibility, analysis may focus on metadata, protocol behavior, or packet payload inspection.

## Packet analysis in network operations

Packet analysis is commonly used for troubleshooting, protocol debugging, security investigations, incident response, DNS analysis, VoIP troubleshooting, and application-performance investigations.

Because packet-level visibility shows how communication actually occurred across the network, packet analysis is often considered a reliable source of troubleshooting and forensic visibility.

Operators commonly investigate:

- Packet loss and retransmissions
- High latency and unstable sessions
- DNS failures and protocol errors
- Application communication problems
- Suspicious or unexpected traffic behavior
- TLS or transport-layer issues

Historical packet visibility is especially useful for investigating intermittent problems, recurring protocol failures, and communication issues that may not appear during real-time analysis alone.

## Common packet analysis use cases

| Use case | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Troubleshooting | Investigate latency, retransmissions, and communication failures |
| Protocol analysis | Decode and inspect protocol behavior |
| Security investigations | Analyze suspicious communication or attack activity |
| Application analysis | Investigate requests, responses, and session behavior |
| Forensic analysis | Review historical packet activity during investigations |

The usefulness of packet analysis depends on reliable capture quality, protocol visibility, and sufficient historical retention.

## Challenges in packet analysis

Effective packet analysis depends on accurate traffic capture, scalable packet storage, reliable timestamps, and efficient investigation workflows.

Common challenges include encrypted traffic, high-volume packet capture, storage-retention requirements, distributed monitoring environments, and packet loss during capture.

Organizations commonly improve packet visibility by combining packet analysis with flow telemetry, DNS visibility, infrastructure metrics, historical traffic analysis, and security logs.

Correlating packet-level visibility with broader telemetry helps operators investigate both detailed protocol behavior and larger traffic patterns across the network.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports packet-analysis workflows through packet capture, protocol visibility, flow telemetry analysis, and historical traffic investigations.

Using packet-analysis workflows together with NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, DNS visibility, and historical traffic analysis, operators can investigate packet-level communication behavior, correlate packets with flows and applications, analyze retransmissions and anomalies, and perform historical traffic investigations across enterprise, ISP, telecom, WAN, and distributed network environments.

Additional packet-analysis workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:

### What does packet analysis reveal?

Packet analysis can reveal retransmissions, latency conditions, protocol behavior, malformed packets, DNS failures, application communication issues, and traffic associated with troubleshooting or security investigations.

### What tools are used for packet analysis?

Packet-analysis tools such as Wireshark, tcpdump, and Trisul inspect captured traffic using packet decoding, filtering, protocol analysis, and PCAP investigation workflows.

### Why is packet analysis important?

Packet analysis is important because it provides detailed visibility into actual network communication and helps operators investigate issues that may not be visible through summarized telemetry or infrastructure metrics alone.

### Why is packet analysis useful for troubleshooting?

Packet analysis helps operators see how communication actually occurred across the network, making it useful for investigating retransmissions, latency spikes, DNS failures, protocol issues, and application behavior.

### Can packet analysis inspect encrypted traffic?

Encrypted traffic may limit payload visibility, but packet analysis can still provide useful information through metadata, TLS handshakes, traffic timing, protocol behavior, and communication patterns.
