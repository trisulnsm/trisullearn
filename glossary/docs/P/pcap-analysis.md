# What is PCAP analysis?

**PCAP analysis** examines packet capture files to investigate protocol behavior, troubleshoot communication problems, analyze traffic activity, and support security and forensic investigations using packet-level visibility.

PCAP files contain captured network traffic including packet headers and, depending on visibility and encryption, packet payload data.

By analyzing packet timing, retransmissions, protocol behavior, metadata, and communication patterns, analysts can understand how systems and applications interacted across the network.

Because PCAP analysis inspects actual captured traffic instead of summarized telemetry alone, it often reveals communication details that are not visible through flow records or infrastructure metrics.

---

## How PCAP analysis works

PCAP analysis uses packet-analysis tools to inspect captured traffic stored in formats such as PCAP or PCAPNG.

Analysts commonly filter traffic using IP addresses, ports, protocols, timestamps, or communication behavior to isolate relevant sessions during investigations.

Analysis tools can reconstruct communication streams, decode protocols, analyze packet timing, inspect retransmissions, and identify abnormal or failed protocol behavior.

PCAP analysis is especially useful because it allows analysts to replay and investigate historical communication activity after an incident or failure has already occurred.

For example, a PCAP file may reveal that a web application failed because TLS negotiation broke during the handshake, even though flow telemetry only showed successful connectivity between the client and server.

While flow telemetry may show that communication occurred, PCAP analysis can explain why sessions failed, slowed down, retransmitted, or behaved unexpectedly.

Even when traffic is encrypted, PCAP analysis can still provide useful visibility through metadata, TLS handshakes, timing behavior, certificates, retransmissions, and protocol activity.

## PCAP analysis in network operations

PCAP analysis is commonly used for troubleshooting, protocol debugging, security investigations, incident response, DNS analysis, VoIP troubleshooting, packet-loss investigations, and historical forensic analysis.

Because packet-level visibility shows how communication actually occurred across the network, PCAP analysis is often used when summarized telemetry does not provide enough detail to explain failures or abnormal behavior.

Analysts commonly investigate retransmissions, TLS handshake failures, malformed packets, DNS resolution issues, protocol violations, application communication problems, suspicious traffic behavior, and latency-related issues.

Historical packet visibility is especially valuable for investigating intermittent failures, recurring protocol issues, or communication problems that may no longer be occurring during live analysis.

## Common PCAP analysis techniques

| Technique | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Traffic filtering | Isolate relevant packets or sessions |
| Stream reconstruction | Rebuild communication sessions for analysis |
| Protocol decoding | Interpret transport and application protocols |
| Timeline analysis | Analyze packet timing and event sequences |
| Statistical analysis | Examine traffic patterns and performance behavior |
| Packet inspection | Inspect headers and, where visible, payload data |

These techniques help analysts investigate both protocol-level behavior and broader communication activity.

## Challenges in PCAP analysis

Effective PCAP analysis depends on reliable packet capture, accurate timestamps, scalable storage, and efficient investigation workflows.

Common challenges include encrypted traffic visibility limitations, large-scale packet storage requirements, packet loss during capture, high-speed traffic environments, distributed monitoring infrastructure, and long-term historical retention.

Organizations commonly improve PCAP investigations by combining packet analysis with flow telemetry, DNS visibility, infrastructure metrics, historical traffic analysis, and security telemetry.

Correlating packet-level activity with broader telemetry helps analysts investigate both detailed protocol behavior and larger traffic patterns across the network.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports PCAP-analysis workflows through packet analysis, protocol visibility, flow telemetry correlation, and historical traffic investigations.

Using packet capture together with NetFlow, IPFIX, packet-analysis workflows, and historical traffic visibility, operators can investigate packet-level communication behavior, analyze retransmissions and anomalies, correlate packets with flows and applications, and perform historical traffic investigations across enterprise, ISP, telecom, WAN, cloud, and distributed environments.

Additional packet-analysis workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:
