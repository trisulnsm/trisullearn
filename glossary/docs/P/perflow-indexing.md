# What is per-flow indexing?

**Per-flow indexing** is the organization of flow records and traffic metadata so individual network conversations can be efficiently stored, searched, filtered, correlated, and retrieved across large telemetry environments.

It is commonly used in flow analytics platforms, network traffic analysis systems, historical telemetry archives, security-monitoring environments, and forensic workflows where operators must investigate large volumes of retained traffic data efficiently.

Per-flow indexing makes large-scale historical traffic investigations operationally feasible by allowing operators to rapidly retrieve specific traffic activity without performing slow sequential scans across massive telemetry datasets.

---

## How per-flow indexing works

Traffic-analysis systems generate flow records that describe observed network conversations using metadata such as source and destination addresses, ports, protocols, timestamps, interfaces, traffic direction, ASN relationships, traffic volume, session duration, and application-related telemetry.

Per-flow indexing organizes this metadata into searchable structures so analytics platforms can efficiently retrieve matching conversations and historical traffic activity across large telemetry archives.

Indexed flow storage allows operators to rapidly retrieve conversations, applications, hosts, protocols, traffic patterns, and historical communication activity across extremely large telemetry environments without performing inefficient sequential dataset scans.

Operators may therefore search historical telemetry for:
- communication involving specific systems
- traffic activity across defined time ranges
- application or protocol behavior
- ASN or subnet-related traffic
- high-volume or anomalous communication patterns

Without indexing, large traffic datasets become increasingly difficult to search operationally as telemetry scale and retention periods grow.

## Per-flow indexing in network operations

Operations and security teams rely on indexed flow storage to investigate incidents, analyze historical communication patterns, troubleshoot application behavior, perform traffic drill-down workflows, and rapidly pivot across large telemetry datasets during operational investigations.

Per-flow indexing becomes especially important in environments where telemetry retention spans long operational periods and analysts must reconstruct prior traffic behavior quickly during troubleshooting or security investigations.

Historical indexing allows teams to correlate:
- hosts and conversations
- applications and protocols
- traffic behavior over time
- subscriber or ASN activity
- anomalous communication patterns
- infrastructure and traffic events

This becomes operationally critical in ISP, enterprise, telecom, broadband, and cloud environments where telemetry volumes may scale to millions of flow records per minute across distributed infrastructures.

Per-flow indexing therefore functions as a form of searchable operational memory that preserves historical communication visibility across large environments over extended periods of time.

## Common indexed flow fields

| Indexed field | Operational meaning |
|---|---|
| Source and destination IP | Communication endpoints |
| Ports and protocols | Application and transport behavior |
| Timestamp | When communication occurred |
| Interface | Observation location or traffic path |
| ASN | Autonomous system attribution |
| Traffic direction | Ingress or egress behavior |
| Flow volume | Bandwidth and traffic consumption |
| Session duration | Communication persistence |

Different analytics platforms may index additional metadata depending on operational and investigative requirements.

## What makes per-flow indexing operationally effective

Operationally effective per-flow indexing depends heavily on scalable metadata organization, efficient query structures, historical retention strategy, and telemetry correlation so large traffic datasets remain searchable and operationally useful over long periods of time.

Large environments may generate enormous telemetry volumes continuously, making indexing architecture directly responsible for query performance, investigative speed, storage efficiency, retention scalability, and operational visibility.

Poor indexing strategies can create slow searches, excessive storage overhead, incomplete query visibility, limited retention practicality, and operational bottlenecks that reduce the usefulness of historical traffic analytics.

Per-flow indexing becomes significantly more valuable when correlated with packet analysis, ASN analytics, infrastructure telemetry, anomaly detection, behavioral analytics, and historical investigation workflows across distributed environments.

As telemetry environments scale, organizations increasingly depend on indexed traffic storage to maintain searchable historical visibility and support rapid operational investigations across massive long-term telemetry archives.

## In Trisul

Trisul Network Analytics uses indexed flow and traffic storage to support searchable traffic investigations, historical traffic analysis, conversation analysis, drill-down workflows, and scalable operational visibility across large telemetry environments.

Using NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, packet analysis, ASN-aware telemetry, and historical traffic analytics, Trisul helps operators rapidly search and analyze communication behavior, investigate hosts and conversations, review application and protocol activity, analyze traffic trends, correlate historical telemetry, and perform large-scale operational investigations across enterprise, ISP, telecom, broadband, and cloud infrastructures.

Trisul’s indexed telemetry architecture helps organizations maintain long-term searchable traffic visibility while supporting scalable analytics and efficient historical investigation workflows across high-volume environments.

This becomes especially valuable in environments where operational visibility depends heavily on retaining and rapidly searching large-scale historical traffic datasets over extended time periods.

Additional flow-monitoring and traffic-analysis workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:
