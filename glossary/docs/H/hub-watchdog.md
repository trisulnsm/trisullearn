# What is Hub Watchdog?

**Hub Watchdog** is a Trisul feature that monitors the health, availability, and connectivity of Hub nodes within a distributed deployment.

Its primary purpose is not simply to monitor Hub status, but to help ensure that monitoring visibility remains available across the environment.

A useful way to think about Hub Watchdog is:

> **Production monitoring protects services.**
>
> **Hub Watchdog protects monitoring visibility itself.**

By detecting Hub failures and communication problems early, administrators can identify conditions that may create blind spots in monitoring and analytics.

---

## Why Hub Watchdog matters

Modern monitoring platforms are critical operational infrastructure.

When a Hub becomes unavailable, production systems may continue operating normally, but administrators can lose visibility into monitored activity.

For example:

- Probe nodes may continue collecting data
- Network services may continue operating
- Traffic may continue flowing

Yet analytics, dashboards, and investigative workflows may become unavailable if communication with a Hub is disrupted.

This creates a monitoring blind spot.

Hub Watchdog exists to identify these situations quickly so that administrators can restore visibility before operational awareness is affected.

---

## How Hub Watchdog works

In distributed Trisul deployments, Hub nodes play a central role in coordinating, aggregating, and presenting analytics collected from Probe nodes and other monitoring components.

Hub Watchdog continuously monitors the operational status of these Hub nodes and verifies that expected communication is occurring.

When connectivity is interrupted, a Hub becomes unavailable, or communication behavior deviates from expected operation, Hub Watchdog generates alerts or events for administrator review.

This allows administrators to detect monitoring infrastructure issues before they significantly affect operational visibility.

---

## Hub Watchdog in network operations

Distributed monitoring deployments often span:

- Multiple sites
- Multiple data centers
- Distributed domains
- Disaster recovery environments

In these architectures, monitoring infrastructure must remain operational even when network conditions change.

Operations teams use Hub Watchdog to verify that Hub nodes remain reachable and functioning correctly. Early visibility into monitoring infrastructure issues helps reduce investigative delays and prevents gaps in analytics coverage.

This becomes particularly important during:

- Network outages
- Failover events
- Infrastructure maintenance
- Connectivity disruptions
- Disaster recovery scenarios

Because monitoring systems are often relied upon during incidents, maintaining their availability is a critical operational requirement.

## Hub Watchdog vs device monitoring

| Category | Hub Watchdog | Device Monitoring |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Primary focus | Monitoring infrastructure health | Production infrastructure health |
| Monitored entities | Hub nodes and monitoring components | Routers, switches, servers, and firewalls |
| Operational purpose | Preserve monitoring visibility | Preserve service availability |
| Alert scope | Monitoring-system issues | Infrastructure and service issues |
| Monitoring target | Analytics infrastructure | Production infrastructure |
| Best fit | Distributed Trisul deployments | General infrastructure monitoring |

Device monitoring focuses on production systems.

Hub Watchdog focuses on the systems responsible for providing visibility into those production systems.

Both are essential for effective operations.

---

## What makes Hub Watchdog effective

The effectiveness of Hub Watchdog depends on three principles:

### Visibility preservation

The primary objective is ensuring that monitoring coverage remains available throughout the environment.

### Early failure detection

Rapid identification of communication failures helps reduce the duration and impact of monitoring blind spots.

### Resilience

Distributed deployments benefit from redundancy, failover planning, and multiple monitoring paths that reduce dependence on a single component.

Administrators should also periodically verify that Hub health alerts are functioning correctly. Monitoring infrastructure should never fail silently.

---

## In Trisul

Hub Watchdog is directly relevant to Trisul because it monitors the health and connectivity of Hub nodes within distributed deployments.

The feature helps administrators identify communication failures, unavailable Hub nodes, and operational conditions that could affect monitoring visibility.

By providing oversight of the monitoring infrastructure itself, Hub Watchdog complements Trisul's distributed monitoring architecture and helps ensure that analytics, investigations, dashboards, and operational visibility remain available across multiple locations and domains.

Rather than monitoring production traffic directly, Hub Watchdog helps ensure that the systems responsible for monitoring that traffic remain operational.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is Hub Watchdog?

Hub Watchdog is a Trisul feature that monitors the operational health and connectivity status of Hub nodes, helping administrators identify failures and communication issues in distributed deployments.

### Why is Hub Watchdog important?

Distributed monitoring environments depend on reliable communication between components. Hub Watchdog helps identify outages, connectivity failures, and operational issues that could affect monitoring visibility.

### What types of issues can Hub Watchdog detect?

Hub Watchdog can help identify communication failures, unavailable Hub nodes, interrupted connectivity, and other conditions that affect the operation of distributed monitoring infrastructure.

### Does Hub Watchdog repair failures automatically?

No. Hub Watchdog is a monitoring and alerting feature. It helps administrators identify operational problems but does not automatically repair infrastructure failures.

### Who uses Hub Watchdog?

Hub Watchdog is primarily used by administrators managing distributed Trisul deployments, multi-site monitoring environments, and large-scale network analytics infrastructures.

### Why is monitoring Hub health important?

Because Hub failures can reduce or interrupt monitoring visibility even when production systems continue operating normally. Hub Watchdog helps identify these situations before they create significant operational blind spots.
