# What is host monitor?

**Host monitor** is a network analytics view that tracks **traffic, communication patterns, and operational behavior** for a specific **host or endpoint** using **flow telemetry, packet analysis, historical trends, and contextual metadata**. It focuses on a single endpoint—such as a workstation, server, virtual machine, cloud instance, or subscriber device—and shows how that system uses the network over time. This is commonly used for **troubleshooting, security investigations, capacity analysis, and endpoint visibility**, letting operators pivot from aggregate dashboards down into a single host’s activity card.

---

## How host monitor works

Host monitoring gathers telemetry associated with a specific endpoint (by IP, hostname, or device‑identifier) and then aggregates and time‑series‑aligns it for investigation. The workflow is: **telemetry collection → host identification → behavior aggregation → historical analysis → drill‑down**. Common telemetry sources include **NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, packet‑derived flows, DNS logs, firewall events, and host‑ or subscriber‑metadata**. From this, a host‑monitor view can expose **bandwidth consumption, top peers, applications, ports, protocols, traffic direction, session behavior, historical trends, and anomaly indicators** for that host.

---

## Host monitor in network operations

In **NOC** environments, host monitoring supports **endpoint‑troubleshooting, application‑performance analysis, capacity planning, and congestion investigations**, by revealing which applications a host uses, which peers it talks to most, and how its bandwidth evolves. In **SOC** workflows, it becomes an **endpoint‑investigation lens** for **threat‑hunting, beaconing analysis, lateral‑movement, and data‑exfiltration investigations**, where analysts compare a host’s behavior against baselines and correlate its flows with DNS, firewall, and endpoint logs. In **ISP and carrier** settings, host‑monitor‑style views are often used for **subscriber‑troubleshooting and usage‑analysis**, where operators must inspect per‑device traffic without losing scalability at network scale.

## Common host-monitor views

| View | Operational purpose |
|------|----------------------|
| Bandwidth usage | Analyze how much traffic a host consumes |
| Communication peers | Discover a host’s main conversation partners |
| Applications and protocols | Reveal what services or protocols it uses |
| Ports and services | Show which ports and services are active |
| Traffic trends | Identify long‑term behavior changes or anomalies |
| Directional traffic | Separate incoming vs outgoing communication |

Depending on telemetry, these views can be extended with **ASN‑, geography‑, DNS‑, or subscriber‑based context**, enriching each host with additional operational meaning.

---

## Host monitor vs host analytics

**Host monitor** is an **operational, interactive view** into a specific host, typically used during **troubleshooting, incident‑response, or real‑time investigation**. **Host analytics** is a broader **analytical practice** that interprets a host’s behavior over time, often comparing it against baselines and other hosts to detect anomalies or long‑term patterns. Practically, a host‑monitor page is the “pane‑of‑glass” through which host‑analytics results are consumed and acted upon, making the two workflows complementary rather than competing.

---

## What makes host monitoring effective

Host monitoring is most effective when it has **accurate host‑identification, historical telemetry, and rich metadata**. Challenges include **NAT, dynamic IPs, shared systems, cloud‑mobility, and incomplete telemetry**, which can blur or misattribute endpoint behavior. Improving visibility usually involves **combining flow‑based telemetry with DNS resolution, endpoint inventories, and subscriber mapping**, and indexing host‑level traffic so that queries on an IP or hostname return consistent, time‑spanning behavior cards. Effective teams also maintain **behavioral baselines and integrated anomaly‑detection rules** around monitored hosts.

## How Trisul handles host monitor

Trisul supports **host‑monitor‑style workflows** by exposing **host‑level traffic visibility, historical‑flow analysis, and investigative drill‑downs** for any endpoint. Through **Explore Flows, Top‑K analytics, Flow Taggers, traffic‑pattern views, and historical‑query mechanisms**, operators can click a host in a dashboard and see its **end‑to‑end communication history, top peers, applications, and directional trends**. This is especially useful for **endpoint‑troubleshooting, threat‑hunting, capacity‑analysis, and subscriber‑usage‑investigations**, where Trisul’s flow‑centric engine and historical‑indexing turn per‑host telemetry into an actionable, searchable host‑monitor card.
