# What is historical traffic analysis?

**Historical traffic analysis** is the process of examining **retained network telemetry and traffic data over time** to identify **trends, recurring patterns, anomalies, utilization growth, and operational behavior** for troubleshooting, capacity planning, and security investigations. Instead of focusing on “right now,” it asks what traffic looked like yesterday, last month, or last year, and how conditions have evolved. This view is essential for understanding **long‑term capacity needs, recurring congestion, baseline behavior, and slow‑moving or intermittent security events** that are invisible in real‑time dashboards.

---

## How historical traffic analysis works

Historical analysis depends on **continuous telemetry collection and retention**, typically from **NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, J‑Flow, SNMP metrics, packet‑derived flows, interface counters, and DNS or application logs**. The workflow is: **collection → retention/indexing → aggregation → trend analysis → investigation**. Operators aggregate metrics such as **bandwidth, application volume, protocol distribution, flow counts, and interface utilization** over time windows (hourly, daily, weekly), then visualize trends and drill into specific periods after incidents, policy changes, or upgrades. The quality of analysis is directly tied to **telemetry completeness, retention depth, aggregation intervals, and indexing performance**.

---

## Historical traffic analysis in network operations

In **NOC** environments, historical analysis underpins **capacity planning, congestion investigations, WAN‑optimization, and traffic‑engineering**, by revealing recurring bottlenecks, peak‑usage patterns, and application‑growth curves. In **SOC** workflows, it supports **threat hunting, incident‑investigation, and anomaly detection**, because many threats (such as beaconing or slow‑moving attackers) only become obvious when traffic is compared against historical baselines over days or weeks. In **ISP and carrier** settings, historical analysis drives **subscriber‑trend reporting, backbone‑capacity modeling, peering‑optimization, and traffic‑forecasting**, where years‑of‑retained telemetry become a core planning asset.

## Common historical analysis capabilities

| Capability | Operational purpose |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Bandwidth trending | Track utilization growth over time |
| Top‑K analysis | Identify dominant traffic sources historically |
| Seasonal pattern analysis | Detect daily, weekly, or periodic cycles |
| Before‑and‑after comparison | Validate network or policy changes |
| Traffic baselining | Define “normal” behavior for alerts |
| Historical anomaly detection | Find unusual long‑term shifts |

Depending on the platform, these can be combined with **traffic‑forecasting**, **capacity‑modeling**, **security‑timeline reconstruction**, and **cross‑source correlation** (flows, packets, logs, DNS) to build a robust long‑term understanding of behavior.

## Historical analysis vs real‑time monitoring

**Real‑time monitoring** focuses on **current or near‑real‑time visibility**, immediate alerting, and operational response, using live flows, SNMP, and streaming telemetry to detect incidents as they occur. **Historical traffic analysis** focuses on **retrospective, time‑spanning investigation**, using stored telemetry to answer “how bad is this really?” and “has this happened before?” The two are complementary: real‑time monitors raise alerts, and historical analysis helps triage them, validate impact, and decide whether to adjust capacity, policy, or security posture.

---

## What makes historical traffic analysis effective

Effectiveness depends on **long‑term retention, performant indexing, consistent telemetry, and good correlation workflows**. Challenges include **large data volumes, storage scalability, high‑cardinality traffic, sampling artifacts, and incomplete or inconsistent exporters**. To get useful historical insights, organizations need **accurate time‑synchronization**, **well‑defined baselines**, **aggregation‑interval discipline**, and **centralized analytics that can correlate flows, packets, DNS, and logs** over months or years. When done well, historical analysis transforms raw telemetry into **operational knowledge**, telling not just what happened, but what it means over time.

## How Trisul handles historical traffic analysis

Trisul supports **historical traffic analysis** by **retaining and indexing flow and packet‑based telemetry** and exposing it via **Explore Flows, Top‑K analytics, traffic‑pattern dashboards, and historical‑query workflows**. Operators can pivot between **time‑series trend views**, **Top‑K traffic sources**, and **detailed flow records** to understand long‑term trends, recurring congestion, and security‑relevant patterns. This is especially useful for **capacity planning, traffic‑engineering, historical troubleshooting, threat‑investigations, and operational reporting**, where Trisul’s scale‑optimized indexing and traffic‑correlation features turn retained telemetry into an actionable historical lens.
