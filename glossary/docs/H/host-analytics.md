# What is host analytics?

**Host analytics** is the analysis of **traffic, communication patterns, and operational behavior** associated with a specific host or endpoint using **flow telemetry, packet analysis, historical trends, and contextual metadata**. Instead of looking at the network as a whole, it drills down to individual systems such as workstations, servers, virtual machines, cloud instances, or IoT devices, answering questions like “who is this host talking to?”, “how much does it transfer?”, and “has its behavior changed over time?”. Host analytics is widely used for **troubleshooting, security investigations, endpoint visibility, and capacity‑aware design**.

---

## How host analytics works

Host analytics starts by **grouping telemetry around a specific endpoint** (IP address, hostname, or device‑identifier) and then aggregating metrics over time. Common telemetry sources include **NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, packet‑derived flows, DNS logs, firewall events, and host metadata**. The workflow is: **telemetry collection → host identification → behavior aggregation → trend analysis → investigation**. Operators can examine a host’s **bandwidth, peers, applications, ports, protocols, traffic direction, session patterns, and anomaly‑scores** to understand whether its activity is normal, overloaded, or potentially malicious.

---

## Host analytics in network operations

In **NOC** environments, host analytics supports **application‑troubleshooting, capacity planning, and performance analysis** by revealing which applications a host uses, which peers it talks to most, and how its bandwidth consumption evolves. In **SOC** workflows, it is central to **threat‑hunting, beaconing analysis, lateral‑movement investigations, and data‑exfiltration detection**, because analysts can inspect a single host’s communication history, compare it against baselines, and correlate it with DNS, firewall, and endpoint logs. In **ISP and carrier** settings, host analytics improves **subscriber‑visibility and customer‑troubleshooting**, where operators need to understand per‑device usage without losing scalability at network scale.

## Common host analytics views

| View | Operational purpose |
|------|----------------------|
| Top peers | Discover a host’s main communication partners |
| Applications and protocols | Reveal what services or protocols a host uses |
| Traffic trends | Spot long‑term changes in usage or anomalies |
| Ports and services | Identify listening or client‑side service usage |
| Directional traffic | Separate inbound and outbound behavior |
| Historical ranking | Track how a host’s activity compares over time |

Depending on telemetry, these views can be extended with **ASN‑, geography‑, or DNS‑based context**, enriching each host with more operational meaning.

## Host analytics vs network‑wide analytics

**Host analytics** focuses on **individual‑endpoint behavior**, helping operators investigate specific workstations, servers, or subscribers. **Network‑wide analytics** focuses on **aggregate patterns** across the entire topology, such as link‑utilization, application‑mix, or top‑talker distributions. The two are complementary: network‑wide dashboards show where traffic is dense, and host analytics explains **which devices drive that traffic** and how they are behaving. In security, this combination lets teams go from “a segment is spiking” to “this specific host caused the spike.”

---

## What makes host analytics effective

Host analytics is effective when it has **accurate host‑identification, good historical telemetry, and rich metadata**. Challenges include **NAT, dynamic IPs, shared systems, and cloud‑provider mobility**, which can obscure true endpoint identity. Organizations improve accuracy by combining **flow‑based visibility, DNS resolution, endpoint inventories, and metadata enrichment**, and by indexing host‑level telemetry so that queries on a given IP or hostname return consistent, time‑spanning behavior views. Effective teams also define **behavioral baselines** (e.g., a “normal” email‑server pattern) to detect anomalies automatically.

## How Trisul handles host analytics

Trisul supports **host analytics** by exposing **host‑level traffic visibility, historical‑flow analysis, and investigative workflows** built around any chosen endpoint. Through **Explore Flows, Top‑K analytics, Flow Taggers, and traffic‑pattern views**, operators can pivot from broad dashboards to **detailed per‑host traffic cards**, drilling into peers, applications, and time‑series trends. This is useful for **endpoint‑troubleshooting, threat‑investigations, capacity‑analysis, and subscriber‑usage reporting**, where Trisul’s flow‑centric engine and historical‑indexing turn per‑host telemetry into an actionable, searchable resource.
