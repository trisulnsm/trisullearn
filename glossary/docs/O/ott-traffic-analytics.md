# What is OTT traffic analytics?

**OTT traffic analytics** analyzes **Over-The-Top (OTT) application traffic** such as streaming video, voice, messaging, and collaboration services to provide visibility into bandwidth consumption, traffic patterns, application behavior, and usage trends.

OTT applications deliver services across the public internet instead of through dedicated provider-controlled delivery systems. Common examples include video-streaming platforms, VoIP applications, conferencing tools, messaging services, and cloud-based collaboration platforms.

These applications now generate a significant portion of internet traffic across enterprise, ISP, telecom, cloud, and service-provider environments. As a result, OTT traffic analytics helps operators understand how streaming, conferencing, and cloud applications affect bandwidth usage, traffic growth, congestion, and user experience across modern networks.

## How OTT traffic analytics works

OTT analytics identifies application traffic using flow telemetry, packet analysis, DPI techniques, DNS visibility, TLS metadata, and traffic-behavior analysis.

Because many OTT applications use encrypted traffic and distributed cloud infrastructure, application identification often depends on metadata, DNS patterns, TLS handshakes, traffic behavior, and protocol characteristics rather than packet payload inspection alone.

For example, video-streaming platforms may generate large sustained traffic volumes during peak usage periods, while conferencing and VoIP applications are more sensitive to latency, jitter, and packet loss.

After traffic is identified, analytics platforms group and analyze usage patterns by application, subscriber, geography, interface, or time period to understand bandwidth demand, traffic distribution, and quality-related behavior.

Historical traffic visibility is especially useful for understanding long-term streaming growth, recurring congestion periods, collaboration-traffic trends, and changes in application usage patterns over time.

## OTT traffic analytics in network operations

OTT analytics helps operators understand how internet-delivered applications affect infrastructure performance and bandwidth consumption.

These workflows are commonly used for streaming-traffic visibility, collaboration-application analysis, ISP traffic engineering, subscriber-usage analysis, WAN visibility, congestion investigations, peering analysis, and long-term capacity planning.

For example, streaming platforms may generate heavy downstream traffic during peak hours, while collaboration applications may require stable latency and low packet loss to maintain acceptable voice and video quality.

OTT visibility is important because encrypted streaming, conferencing, and cloud applications often consume substantial bandwidth while making traffic classification and quality analysis more difficult than traditional application environments.

Operators commonly investigate high-bandwidth applications, traffic spikes, regional usage patterns, subscriber behavior, quality issues, and congestion associated with OTT services.

## Common OTT analytics metrics

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Bandwidth consumption | Traffic volume associated with OTT applications |
| Application distribution | Relative traffic share across OTT services |
| Peak usage periods | Times of highest OTT traffic demand |
| Subscriber or regional usage | Traffic behavior by subscriber group or geography |
| Traffic growth trends | Long-term changes in OTT traffic behavior |
| Quality indicators | Latency, jitter, retransmissions, buffering, or packet-loss behavior |

Exact visibility depends on telemetry quality, encryption visibility, and application-identification methods.

## Challenges in OTT traffic analysis

Effective OTT analytics depends on accurate application identification, scalable telemetry collection, historical visibility, and reliable traffic correlation.

Common challenges include encrypted traffic, CDN-based traffic distribution, dynamic cloud infrastructure, high-volume streaming environments, subscriber correlation, and identifying applications that use shared cloud services or distributed delivery networks.

Organizations commonly improve OTT visibility by combining flow telemetry, packet analysis, DNS visibility, subscriber-aware analysis, infrastructure monitoring, and historical traffic investigations.

Correlating these telemetry sources helps operators understand both application behavior and broader traffic patterns across the network.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports OTT traffic analytics workflows through flow telemetry analysis, packet analysis, application visibility, and historical traffic investigations.

Using NetFlow, IPFIX, packet analysis, protocol visibility, and historical traffic workflows, operators can analyze OTT application traffic patterns, investigate streaming and collaboration traffic behavior, correlate application activity with subscribers and interfaces, and perform historical traffic analysis across enterprise, ISP, telecom, WAN, and distributed environments.

Additional traffic-analysis workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:
