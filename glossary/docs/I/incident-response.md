# What is incident response?

**Incident response** is the organized approach to detecting, responding to, containing, and recovering from security incidents or cyberattacks. It follows a structured response process designed to minimize damage, reduce recovery time, preserve visibility into the event, and lower the risk of recurrence.

Incident response is used when organizations need to investigate and manage security breaches, malware infections, suspicious communication patterns, unauthorized access attempts, infrastructure disruptions, or other events that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems and services.

Rather than focusing only on detection, incident response coordinates how teams identify the event, contain the impact, investigate affected systems, remediate root causes, restore services, and improve future readiness.

## How incident response works

Incident response begins with preparation through policies, procedures, tooling, escalation workflows, and response training so organizations can respond consistently when incidents occur.

A typical incident-response lifecycle includes:

1. **Preparation** – Establish policies, playbooks, tooling, escalation procedures, and response training
2. **Identification** – Detect and validate suspicious activity using alerts, logs, IDS events, flow telemetry, and network monitoring
3. **Containment** – Limit the spread or impact of the incident by isolating hosts, restricting communication, or segmenting affected systems
4. **Eradication** – Remove malware, unauthorized access, malicious persistence, or infrastructure root causes
5. **Recovery** – Restore systems, validate service stability, and monitor for recurring activity
6. **Lessons learned** – Review the incident, improve procedures, update detections, and refine readiness workflows

The exact workflow varies between organizations, but structured response processes help reduce confusion and improve coordination during high-impact infrastructure or security events.

Containment decisions often balance security risk against service availability because isolating systems too aggressively may disrupt critical business operations or dependent services.

## Incident response in network operations

In **security operations**, incident response is central to handling malware activity, unauthorized access attempts, phishing-related compromise, suspicious outbound communication, reconnaissance behavior, and potential data exfiltration. Analysts frequently investigate traffic telemetry, DNS activity, firewall events, authentication logs, and endpoint telemetry to reconstruct attacker behavior and determine service impact.

In **network operations**, incident-response workflows are also used during outages, routing instability, packet-loss events, congestion conditions, service degradation, and infrastructure failures. Teams investigate what changed, how traffic behavior evolved, which systems were affected, and whether the issue propagated across additional services or network segments.

In hybrid-cloud, SD-WAN, and distributed enterprise environments, incident response often spans multiple telemetry domains including WAN telemetry, VPN connectivity, cloud traffic visibility, endpoint records, and distributed infrastructure logs where maintaining correlated historical visibility becomes especially important.

The results of incident-response activities commonly feed into monitoring improvements, response playbooks, security controls, escalation procedures, and detection-rule tuning workflows.

## The 6 steps of incident response

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Preparation | Build policies, playbooks, tooling, and readiness workflows |
| Identification | Detect and validate suspicious activity using monitoring, logs, alerts, IDS telemetry, and traffic analysis |
| Containment | Limit the spread or service impact of the incident |
| Eradication | Remove threats, unauthorized access, malware, or infrastructure root causes |
| Recovery | Restore systems and validate stable service behavior |
| Lessons learned | Review the incident and improve procedures, tooling, and detection workflows |

Organizations that regularly test and refine these workflows generally respond more consistently and reduce recovery time during incidents.

## What makes incident response effective

Effective incident response depends heavily on preparation, telemetry visibility, historical retention, and clear response workflows.

Organizations commonly improve incident-response effectiveness through:

- Historical retention of flows, logs, and traffic telemetry
- Centralized visibility across infrastructure and security systems
- Consistent escalation and communication procedures
- Correlation between traffic telemetry, DNS activity, firewall logs, and endpoint visibility
- Well-defined runbooks and investigation workflows
- Regular testing and response exercises

Common challenges include incomplete telemetry, fragmented visibility, inconsistent timestamps, distributed infrastructure complexity, short data-retention windows, and limited packet-level visibility during investigations.

Flow telemetry and packet analysis are especially valuable because they help responders identify affected systems, trace communication paths, investigate suspicious traffic behavior, quantify potential data exfiltration, and validate remediation actions after containment.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports incident-response workflows through flow-based telemetry analysis, historical traffic visibility, packet-analysis workflows, and investigative drill-down capabilities.

Using NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, and J-Flow telemetry together with historical traffic analysis, operators can reconstruct traffic behavior surrounding incidents, trace affected communication paths, and validate whether containment actions successfully reduced malicious communication or abnormal traffic activity.

Response workflows help teams investigate suspicious communication patterns, malware traffic behavior, congestion events, unauthorized access attempts, infrastructure disruptions, and service-impact conditions affecting WAN, cloud, internet-edge, or distributed enterprise environments.

Trisul workflows commonly combine:

- Flow telemetry
- Historical traffic analysis
- Packet-analysis workflows
- DNS and traffic correlation
- Explore Flows investigations

These capabilities are particularly useful for incident response, malware traffic analysis, infrastructure troubleshooting, network-security monitoring, forensic traffic analysis, and service-impact investigations where traffic-level visibility is required to reconstruct and validate response actions accurately.

Additional flow-analysis workflows related to incident response are documented in the Trisul flow documentation:
