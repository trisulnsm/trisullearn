# What is incident investigation?

**Incident investigation** is the process of examining alerts, logs, traffic, and other evidence to determine what happened during a security or infrastructure event. Rather than only detecting that an issue exists, incident investigation focuses on reconstructing the timeline, scope, cause, and impact of the event so teams can contain the problem, remediate affected systems, and reduce the likelihood of recurrence.

Incident investigation is commonly performed after outages, intrusions, configuration errors, suspicious traffic behavior, routing instability, congestion events, or application-performance disruptions where understanding the underlying sequence of events is critical for remediation and long-term reliability.

## How incident investigation works

Incident investigation typically begins when an alert, anomaly, outage, or infrastructure disruption requires deeper analysis.

A common workflow includes:

1. **Evidence collection** – Gather alerts, logs, flow records, packet captures, device telemetry, authentication records, and application or user context
2. **Timeline reconstruction** – Correlate events chronologically across multiple telemetry sources
3. **Impact analysis** – Identify affected hosts, services, applications, interfaces, or network segments
4. **Root-cause analysis** – Determine whether the event was caused by attack activity, misconfiguration, congestion, hardware failure, software issues, or infrastructure changes
5. **Remediation and validation** – Apply corrective actions and validate that the issue has been contained or resolved

The quality of an investigation depends heavily on telemetry completeness, timestamp consistency, historical retention, and the ability to correlate information across multiple systems.

Investigators frequently analyze how events propagated across systems and whether secondary failures, alerts, or service degradation were consequences of the original incident.

## Incident investigation in operations

In **network operations**, incident investigation is commonly used to troubleshoot outages, routing problems, packet loss, congestion events, application slowdowns, and infrastructure instability. Teams investigate what changed, how traffic behavior evolved, which systems were affected, and whether the impact propagated across additional network segments or services.

In **security operations**, investigations focus on suspicious communication patterns, unauthorized access attempts, malware activity, reconnaissance behavior, lateral movement, and potential data exfiltration. Analysts frequently correlate traffic telemetry with firewall logs, DNS activity, endpoint telemetry, authentication records, and threat-intelligence data to reconstruct the sequence of events surrounding the incident.

In hybrid-cloud, SD-WAN, and distributed enterprise environments, incident investigation often spans multiple telemetry domains including WAN telemetry, VPN connectivity, cloud traffic visibility, endpoint visibility, and distributed infrastructure logs where maintaining historical visibility across service boundaries becomes especially important.

The results of investigations commonly feed into incident-response procedures, monitoring improvements, policy adjustments, infrastructure hardening, and detection-rule tuning workflows.

## Common investigation inputs

| Input | Investigative value |
|-------|-------------------|
| Alerts | Initial indication that triggered the investigation |
| Logs | Event history from systems, applications, firewalls, or infrastructure |
| Traffic data | Flow and packet visibility showing communication behavior |
| DNS telemetry | Domain-resolution activity associated with communication flows |
| Authentication records | User login activity and access validation history |
| Endpoint telemetry | Host-level behavior, processes, and security events |
| Packet captures | Detailed packet-level evidence for protocol or payload analysis |
| System records | Infrastructure or host telemetry associated with the event |

Strong investigations typically correlate multiple telemetry sources because relying on a single source often produces incomplete context or misleading conclusions.

## What makes incident investigation effective

Effective incident investigation depends on reliable historical telemetry, synchronized timestamps, centralized visibility, and strong correlation workflows across telemetry sources.

Organizations commonly improve investigation quality through:

- Historical telemetry retention for flows, logs, and traffic records
- Correlation between traffic telemetry, DNS activity, firewall logs, and endpoint visibility
- Centralized dashboards and investigation workflows
- Consistent telemetry normalization across platforms
- Searchable historical traffic and event records

Operational challenges commonly include fragmented visibility, incomplete telemetry, inconsistent timestamps, short retention periods, asymmetric routing visibility gaps, and distributed infrastructure complexity.

Maintaining long-term traffic visibility and correlated telemetry significantly improves the ability to reconstruct events accurately, distinguish root causes from secondary symptoms, and identify how incidents evolved across systems and environments.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports incident-investigation workflows through historical traffic visibility, flow-based telemetry analysis, packet analysis workflows, and investigative drill-down capabilities.

Using NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, and J-Flow telemetry together with historical traffic analysis, operators can reconstruct communication timelines surrounding incidents and correlate suspicious traffic behavior with DNS activity, firewall telemetry, endpoint visibility, and historical flow records to determine how an event evolved over time.

Investigation workflows help teams analyze abnormal traffic behavior, scanning activity, congestion events, malware communication patterns, unauthorized access attempts, and infrastructure disruptions affecting WAN, cloud, internet-edge, or distributed enterprise environments.

Trisul workflows commonly combine:

- Flow telemetry
- Historical traffic analysis
- Packet-analysis workflows
- DNS and traffic correlation
- Explore Flows investigations

These capabilities are particularly useful for security investigations, infrastructure troubleshooting, malware traffic analysis, incident response, root-cause analysis, and network-performance investigations where traffic-level visibility is required to reconstruct events accurately.
