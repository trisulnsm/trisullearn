# What is endpoint monitoring?

**Endpoint monitoring** is the process of observing endpoints such as laptops, servers, workstations, virtual machines, or cloud‑hosted systems for operational health, user activity, security events, and network behavior. It provides visibility into what happens directly on each device, helping operators detect issues, investigate incidents, and correlate host‑level events with broader network‑wide activity.

---

## How endpoint monitoring works

Endpoint monitoring collects telemetry either directly from agents on devices or from associated logs and event‑forwarding systems. Telemetry typically includes process activity, file and registry changes, authentication events, system‑health metrics, resource usage, and network‑connection data. Monitoring platforms analyze this data for anomalies, generate alerts, and present timelines and dashboards for investigation. Different tools vary in depth and scope, from simple performance monitoring to full‑featured EDR‑style behavioral analysis.

---

## Endpoint monitoring in operations

Endpoint monitoring is used in IT operations, security, incident response, and compliance. Use cases include **host‑level troubleshooting**, **security monitoring**, **malware and ransomware investigations**, **user‑behavior analysis**, and **capacity or performance reporting**. Because many attacks and outages start at the endpoint, this visibility is often essential for root‑cause analysis and incident response. Endpoint telemetry also reveals details—such as process execution or logon history—that may be invisible to network‑only monitoring tools.

---

## Endpoint monitoring vs network monitoring

Endpoint monitoring focuses on what happens **on the device**: processes, files, logons, and local events. Network monitoring focuses on **traffic** between systems: flows, sessions, packets, and communication patterns. The two views are complementary: endpoint data can show a process executed on a laptop, while network data can show that same host connecting to a suspicious external IP or exhibiting lateral‑movement behavior. Effective operations usually combine both, stitching endpoint and network telemetry during investigations.

---

## Endpoint monitoring and security investigations

Endpoint monitoring is critical for malware analysis, insider‑threat investigations, credential‑abuse detection, and post‑compromise analysis. Typical indicators include **unusual process execution**, **unauthorized software changes**, **unexpected outbound connections**, **privilege‑escalation attempts**, and **persistence mechanisms**. When paired with network analytics, this visibility helps trace attackers’ movements across the environment and distinguish legitimate administrative activity from abuse.

---

## Operational considerations

Endpoint‑monitoring deployments face challenges such as **patchy coverage**, **agent management**, **performance overhead**, and **alert fatigue**. Missing or misconfigured agents can create blind spots, and large‑scale environments require solid telemetry‑retention and indexing to support investigations. Successful operations usually depend on consistent coverage, centralized dashboards, historical baselining, and integration with network and SIEM‑style tools for cross‑domain correlation.

## How Trisul supports endpoint‑focused investigations

Trisul supports endpoint‑focused investigations by providing network‑level evidence that correlates with host‑level activity. Using **NetFlow, IPFIX, and sFlow**, it exposes traffic patterns associated with specific hosts, such as suspicious external connections, internal lateral movement, or beaconing behavior. Features like **Explore Flows**, historical traffic trending, and anomaly detection allow analysts to trace an endpoint‑detected process or logon across network sessions, validate exfiltration hypotheses, and reconstruct attack timelines. Trisul acts as a traffic‑analytics layer that complements endpoint‑monitoring tools, not as an endpoint‑agent or host‑management platform.
