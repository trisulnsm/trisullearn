# What is an archive in network analytics?

An archive in network analytics is retained historical data stored for later search, reporting, compliance, or forensic review. It extends visibility beyond the live‑data window by keeping older data accessible in a structured, queryable form.

## How an archive works

Operational data is moved from active, high‑speed storage into longer‑term storage while remaining searchable or retrievable. This allows teams to preserve history without keeping everything in expensive real‑time storage.

The archive may include raw data such as logs and packets, or summarized records such as flow aggregates and reports. The exact format and granularity depend on cost, retention goals, and the need for detailed versus high‑level queries.

---

## Archive use in operations

Archives are valuable when teams need to investigate something that happened days, weeks, or months earlier, or when compliance mandates historical reporting. They also support trend analysis and long‑term capacity planning.

Without an archive, visibility effectively ends when live retention expires. That can make late investigations difficult or impossible and may leave gaps in reporting and compliance.

## Common archived data

| Data type   | Use |
|-------------|-----|
| Logs        | Event history for troubleshooting and auditing |
| Flow records| Traffic history for usage, trends, and capacity analysis |
| Packets     | Detailed evidence for deep forensic analysis |
| Summaries   | Long‑term trends and usage reports |

## What makes an archive useful

An archive is useful because it extends the useful life of operational data, allowing teams to revisit the past instead of relying only on live views.  
It is most effective when the archived data is indexed, structured, and easy to search, so investigations and reports can be run quickly without full‑packet replay.
