# What is an aggregate counter group?

An aggregate counter group is a summarized set of related counters combined into one higher‑level metric view. It helps operators analyze traffic or system behavior at a broader level by turning many individual measurements into a single, meaningful value.

---

## How aggregate counter groups work

Individual counters are collected first, for example per‑interface bytes or error rates. Then related values are summed, averaged, or rolled up into a single group.

This lets operators see totals instead of many separate measurements. The result is easier to read and often more useful for reporting and high‑level monitoring.

---

## Aggregate counter groups in network operations

Aggregate counter groups are common in dashboards and reports. They reduce visual clutter by combining related counters—such as all user‑traffic interfaces or all error categories—into a smaller set of summary values.

This is useful when an operator wants a high‑level view of traffic, health, or performance rather than detailed per‑item data, especially in large environments with many devices or links.

---

## Common aggregate views

| Group            | Example |
|------------------|---------|
| Traffic summary  | Total bytes and packets across selected interfaces or zones |
| Error summary    | Combined error, drop, and discard counters |
| Health summary   | Up/down state and availability across a group of devices or links |
| Protocol summary | Traffic volume by protocol family or application class |

## What makes aggregate counter groups useful

Aggregation works best when the grouped counters are logically related. Mixing unrelated metrics can create confusing or misleading summaries.

The key tradeoff is detail versus clarity. Aggregated views are easier to read and compare, but the underlying raw counters are still needed for detailed troubleshooting and root‑cause analysis.

## In Trisul

Trisul can summarize related counters into aggregate counter groups so operators can follow overall system or traffic behavior without losing access to the underlying detailed measurements.  
Through its dashboard and analytics layers, Trisul allows you to view traffic and health metrics either as broad aggregate groups or as fine‑grained per‑device, per‑interface, or per‑zone counters, depending on the use case.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is an aggregate counter group?

An aggregate counter group is a summarized set of related counters combined into one higher‑level metric view. It helps operators analyze traffic or system behavior at a broader level by turning many individual measurements into a single, meaningful value.

### Why are aggregate counter groups useful?

Aggregate counter groups are useful because they reduce many detailed counters into a simpler summary. This makes dashboards easier to read and trends easier to compare, especially in environments with large numbers of devices or interfaces.

### What are examples of aggregate counter groups?

Examples include grouped interface counters, combined traffic counters, protocol summaries, and health summaries. These groups roll up related values—such as bytes, errors, or availability states—into a single view.

### How are aggregate counter groups used in analytics?

Aggregate counter groups are used in analytics to summarize large numbers of measurements into meaningful categories. They support reporting, dashboards, and trend analysis by providing high‑level views that complement detailed per‑item counters.
