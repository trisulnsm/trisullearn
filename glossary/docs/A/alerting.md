# What is alerting?

Alerting is the process of notifying operators when monitored systems, traffic, or services match a condition that may need attention. It converts detected events into actionable notifications so incidents, degradations, and suspicious activity are not missed.

---

## How alerting works

A monitoring or security system watches metrics, logs, flows, or other signals and compares them against rules, thresholds, or learned baselines. When a condition is met, it generates an alert.

The alert may be sent to dashboards, email, chat, or incident‑management tools. The goal is to reduce the time between detection and response, while limiting noise and false positives.

## Alerting in operations

Alerting is central to network and security operations. It helps teams react to outages, performance degradation, suspicious traffic, and policy violations.  

Good alerting reduces blind spots and speeds up incident response, but poor alerting can create noise and alert fatigue. That is why thresholds, baselines, and alert‑routing rules need careful tuning.

## Common alert sources

| Source           | Example |
|------------------|---------|
| Metrics          | High latency, high loss, or abnormal CPU/memory |
| Logs             | Repeated authentication failures or critical errors |
| Flows            | Unusual bandwidth bursts, new destinations, or scan‑like traffic |
| Availability checks | Service or host unreachable, HTTP errors, or DNS failures |

## What makes alerting useful

Alerting is useful when it points to events that are both real and actionable. Too many false positives or low‑signal alerts can cause operators to ignore important signals.

It works best when alerts are enriched with context, such as affected entities, time range, and related metrics. The more background an alert provides, the faster a team can investigate and respond.

## In Trisul

Trisul can generate and support alerting by correlating traffic, behavior, and network conditions to highlight meaningful issues.  
Through its analytics and dashboard layers, Trisul can trigger alerts based on flow‑based conditions, baseline deviations, protocol anomalies, or custom rules, and feed those alerts into external ticketing, chat, or incident‑management tools via integrations.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is alerting?

Alerting is the process of notifying operators when monitored systems, traffic, or services match a condition that may need attention. It converts detected events into actionable notifications so incidents, performance issues, and suspicious activity are not missed.

### Why is alerting important?

Alerting is important because it helps teams respond quickly to failures, anomalies, and security events. It shortens detection and response time, reduces downtime, and supports proactive incident management.

### What triggers an alert?

An alert can be triggered by thresholds, anomalies, outages, policy matches, or correlated events. Common triggers include metric thresholds, repeated errors, unexpected traffic patterns, or combinations of signals that indicate a problem.

### How is alerting used?

Alerting is used to notify teams about conditions that may require investigation or action. Operators configure alert rules so they are notified only when something meaningful happens, and can then use dashboards and logs to triage and resolve the issue.
