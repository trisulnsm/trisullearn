# What is application monitoring?

Application monitoring is the process of observing application behavior, availability, and performance to detect problems and understand user impact. It uses metrics, logs, and traces from services and APIs to show how fast an application responds, how often it fails, and how many users are using it at any time.

---

## How application monitoring works

Application monitoring collects signals from services, APIs, and business transactions. These signals may include response time, error rate, request volume, and the health of databases, caches, or other dependencies.

The goal is to understand whether the application is working as expected and to detect degradations or outages before or as they affect users. When users report issues, application metrics help narrow down where the problem lies.

---

## Application monitoring in network operations

Application monitoring matters because many problems are visible first at the service layer. A network may look healthy, but the application may still be slow or failing.

It also helps teams separate application bugs from infrastructure issues. That distinction saves time during troubleshooting and supports faster root‑cause analysis.

---

## Common application signals

| Signal           | Meaning |
|------------------|---------|
| Response time    | How long application requests take to complete |
| Error rate       | How often requests fail or return errors |
| Request volume   | How much the application is being used (requests per second, etc.) |
| Dependency health| Whether backend services, databases, or APIs are available and responsive |

## What makes application monitoring useful

Application monitoring is most useful when combined with network context. If response times rise at the same time as queueing or packet loss, the cause may lie in the network rather than the application code.

That makes the app view and the traffic view complementary rather than competing. Together, they give a clearer picture of user experience and service health.

## In Trisul

Trisul helps with application monitoring by adding network‑side visibility to application behavior, making it easier to connect service‑level issues with traffic conditions.  
By correlating application‑level symptoms (such as high latency or errors) with flow‑based traffic patterns, interfaces, and protocols, Trisul supports faster troubleshooting and root‑cause analysis without replacing traditional APM tools.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is application monitoring?

Application monitoring is the process of observing application behavior, availability, and performance to detect problems and understand user impact. It uses metrics and logs from services and APIs to show how fast an application responds, how often it fails, and how many users are using it.

### What does application monitoring track?

Application monitoring can track response times, error rates, request volume, dependency behavior, and service health. Together, these signals show how well the application is performing under current load.

### Why is application monitoring important?

Application monitoring is important because it shows how services behave from the user and operations perspective. It helps teams detect problems early, understand user impact, and prioritize remediation.

### How is application monitoring different from network monitoring?

Application monitoring focuses on service behavior, such as response time and error rate, while network monitoring focuses on links, devices, and traffic. Both are often used together to give a complete view of service health and user experience.
