# What is authentication logging?

Authentication logging is the recording of login attempts, success or failure events, and identity‑related actions on systems and networks. It creates a historical record of who tried to access what, when, and from where, which is essential for security, auditing, and incident response.

---

## How authentication logging works

When a user or device tries to sign in, the system records the attempt. That record typically includes the account name, time of attempt, source IP or device identifier, and whether the attempt succeeded or failed.

If access fails, the log may also capture the reason, such as wrong password, account lockout, or policy restriction. This helps administrators distinguish between user error, configuration issues, and potential abuse.

## Authentication logging in operations

Authentication logs are critical for security and operations. They help teams see whether access is working as expected and whether suspicious activity—such as repeated failed logins or logins from unusual locations—may indicate a compromise.

They are also essential during incident review. Correlating authentication events with other logs can reveal patterns such as brute‑force attempts, lateral movement, or misuse of credentials.

## Common authentication log fields

| Field  | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| User   | Account or identity involved |
| Source | Device, host, or network address where the attempt originated |
| Status | Success or failure of the authentication attempt |
| Time   | When the event occurred, including date and time |

## What makes authentication logging useful

Authentication logging is useful because it creates a persistent record of access attempts that can be reviewed after the fact. That record supports:

- **Auditing** compliance with access policies,  
- **Troubleshooting** access problems, and  
- **Incident investigation** for security events.  

It is most effective when logs are centralized, structured, and retained for a sufficient period to cover normal and post‑incident review windows.

## In Trisul

Trisul can correlate authentication‑related events (for example, from syslog or AAA/Identity‑system logs) with traffic activity so operators can understand access behavior across the network.  
By linking a user‑ or device‑level authentication event to corresponding flows, interfaces, and protocols, Trisul supports faster investigation of suspicious access patterns, lateral‑movement indicators, and anomalous post‑login activity.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is authentication logging?

Authentication logging is the recording of login attempts, success or failure events, and identity‑related actions on systems and networks. It creates a historical record of who tried to access what, when, and from where.

### Why is authentication logging important?

Authentication logging is important because it provides evidence of who tried to access a system and whether access was granted. This evidence supports security, compliance, and incident‑response requirements.

### What do authentication logs show?

Authentication logs can show user names, device identities, success or failure status, timestamps, and source information. Together, these fields reveal the context of each access attempt.

### How is authentication logging used?

Authentication logging is used for auditing, troubleshooting, and incident investigation. Teams query authentication logs to verify compliance, diagnose login failures, and trace suspicious or abusive access behavior.
