# What is a retention policy?

A **retention policy** is a defined set of rules that determines how long network traffic data, logs, telemetry, and analytics records are stored before archival or deletion.

Retention policies help organizations maintain historical visibility, support investigations, satisfy compliance requirements, manage storage growth, and preserve important telemetry for troubleshooting or forensic analysis.

Retention policies commonly apply to flow records, packet captures, DNS logs, NAT logs, authentication logs, IPDR records, security events, application telemetry, and infrastructure-monitoring data.

They are widely used in enterprise, ISP, telecom, cloud, security-monitoring, and compliance-focused environments.

## How retention policies work

Retention policies define how long different types of telemetry remain available before archival or deletion based on storage requirements, compliance obligations, investigative needs, and analytical value.

Different telemetry types often use different retention periods because packet captures, flow telemetry, logs, and monitoring records have significantly different storage requirements.

For example:

- Packet captures may be retained for only a few days because they consume large amounts of storage
- Flow records may be retained for several months
- Authentication or compliance-related logs may be retained for multiple years

Organizations balance historical visibility against storage cost, infrastructure scale, indexing requirements, and compliance obligations when designing retention policies.

Retaining more historical telemetry improves investigation and visibility capabilities but also increases storage, indexing, processing, and management requirements.

Modern monitoring systems can generate extremely large telemetry volumes, making long-term storage planning essential.

For example, an organization may retain packet captures for only a few days while storing flow records and authentication logs for several months or years because flow telemetry requires significantly less storage.

## Why retention policies matter

Modern networks continuously generate large volumes of traffic and infrastructure telemetry.

Without retention policies, organizations may struggle to manage storage growth, preserve historical visibility, investigate incidents, support compliance requirements, or maintain long-term analytics workflows.

Retention policies are especially important because many investigations begin days, weeks, or months after suspicious activity or operational problems originally occurred.

Historical telemetry is commonly retained to support forensic investigations, security incident analysis, subscriber traceability, compliance workflows, capacity planning, communication reconstruction, and long-term traffic analysis.

Retention visibility is especially important in ISP, telecom, enterprise, cloud, and compliance-focused environments where historical traffic analysis and subscriber attribution may be required long after traffic activity originally occurred.

## Common retention-policy use cases

### Security investigations

Organizations retain historical traffic and security telemetry to support forensic analysis, incident reconstruction, and communication tracing.

### Compliance monitoring

Logs and infrastructure records may be retained according to regulatory, legal, or organizational requirements.

### Capacity planning

Long-term traffic and utilization trends are stored to support infrastructure planning and forecasting.

### Subscriber traceability

NAT logs, authentication records, and IPDR-related telemetry may be retained to support investigative and compliance workflows.

### Historical traffic analysis

Historical telemetry helps organizations analyze traffic behavior, identify recurring patterns, and investigate long-term infrastructure trends across extended time periods.

## Retention policy vs backup policy

| Feature | Retention policy | Backup policy |
|---|---|---|
| Primary focus | Data lifecycle management | Data recovery |
| Purpose | Control storage duration and visibility | Restore data after failures |
| Main use case | Compliance, investigations, analytics | Disaster recovery and restoration |
| Historical analysis support | Strong | Limited |
| Storage optimization | Core function | Secondary consideration |

Retention policies determine how long telemetry remains available for analysis and investigations, while backup policies focus on recovering systems or data after failures.

## Benefits and challenges of retention policies

Retention policies help organizations preserve historical visibility for investigations, maintain compliance, support long-term analytics, and control storage growth across large telemetry environments.

However, long retention periods may increase storage cost, indexing complexity, telemetry-management overhead, and infrastructure requirements.

Short retention periods may reduce historical visibility and limit the ability to investigate older incidents or communication activity.

Organizations commonly combine flow telemetry, packet analysis, NAT logging, IPDR workflows, authentication records, and historical traffic analysis to support forensic investigations and long-term traffic visibility.

Correlating these telemetry sources helps investigators reconstruct communication behavior, trace subscriber activity, analyze historical traffic patterns, and investigate incidents across extended time periods.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports long-term traffic visibility and retention-oriented analysis workflows for enterprise, ISP, telecom, and compliance-focused environments.

Using flow telemetry, packet-analysis workflows, historical traffic visibility, IPDR analysis, NAT-related visibility, and traffic-investigation capabilities, operators can investigate historical communication patterns, support forensic and subscriber-traceability workflows, analyze long-term traffic behavior, correlate historical telemetry across multiple data sources, and perform investigations across enterprise, ISP, telecom, compliance, and security-monitoring environments.

Additional traffic-analysis and investigation workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:

## FAQ

### What is a retention policy?

A retention policy defines how long monitoring data, logs, telemetry, and traffic records are stored before archival or deletion.

### Why are retention policies important?

Retention policies help organizations manage storage usage, preserve historical visibility, support compliance requirements, and maintain telemetry needed for investigations and analytics.

### What types of data are commonly governed by retention policies?

Flow records, packet captures, NAT logs, DNS logs, IPDR data, authentication logs, security telemetry, and infrastructure-monitoring records are commonly governed by retention policies.

### How long should traffic data be retained?

Retention periods vary depending on regulatory requirements, storage capacity, infrastructure scale, investigation needs, and organizational policies.

### What is the difference between a retention policy and a backup policy?

Retention policies determine how long operational telemetry remains available for analysis, while backup policies focus on restoring systems or data after failures.

### Why are retention policies important for investigations?

Retention policies preserve historical telemetry needed for forensic analysis, incident reconstruction, subscriber attribution, communication tracing, and historical traffic investigations.
