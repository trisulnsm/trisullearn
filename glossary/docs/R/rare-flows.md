# What are rare flows?

**Rare flows** are network traffic flows that occur infrequently, deviate from historical communication patterns, or represent unusual communication behavior compared with established traffic baselines across the environment.

Rare-flow analysis helps operators identify how communication behavior changes over time by revealing traffic relationships, destinations, protocols, applications, timing behavior, or operational patterns that differ significantly from historically observed network activity.

Unlike high-volume traffic analysis, which focuses primarily on bandwidth consumption and utilization, rare-flow analysis focuses on behavioral deviation and communication patterns that appear operationally unusual relative to normal network behavior.

This makes rare-flow analysis operationally valuable in enterprise, ISP, telecom, cloud, broadband, and security-monitoring environments where understanding unexpected traffic behavior is important for troubleshooting, anomaly detection, operational visibility, and historical investigations.

## How rare-flow analysis works

Rare-flow analysis compares current communication behavior against historical traffic baselines to identify uncommon relationships, unusual protocol activity, unexpected destinations, abnormal timing behavior, and previously unseen traffic patterns across the environment.

Traffic analytics platforms analyze flow telemetry, communication frequency, protocol behavior, application usage, traffic direction, destination relationships, historical visibility, and operational baselines to determine whether specific flows are statistically or behaviorally uncommon.

Behavioral analytics systems may classify flows as rare when communication activity:
- occurs infrequently historically
- involves previously unseen systems or destinations
- appears outside expected operational timing patterns
- uses uncommon protocols or applications
- creates unexpected cross-segment communication behavior
- differs significantly from established traffic baselines

Examples may include a host communicating with an external destination it has never previously accessed, internal systems generating unexpected application traffic, low-frequency communication appearing at unusual times, or traffic relationships that diverge from historically established operational behavior.

Rare-flow analysis therefore depends heavily on long-term telemetry retention and historical visibility because behavioral rarity only exists relative to previously observed network activity.

## Rare flows in network operations

Rare flows are operationally important because unusual communication behavior often reveals operational changes that are not immediately visible through traditional infrastructure monitoring alone.

Operations and security teams use rare-flow analysis to investigate unexpected communication behavior, identify abnormal operational changes, analyze previously unseen traffic relationships, and prioritize unusual activity for deeper investigation across large environments.

Rare flows may reveal:
- infrastructure drift
- unauthorized services
- misconfigured systems
- abnormal application behavior
- unexpected external communication
- hidden dependencies
- emerging security threats
- temporary operational changes

At the same time, unusual traffic is not automatically malicious.

Legitimate operational changes such as cloud migrations, vendor integrations, software updates, new applications, backup workflows, temporary workloads, testing activity, or infrastructure deployments can also generate traffic patterns that appear behaviorally rare.

Operational context therefore becomes critical because analysts must distinguish meaningful anomalies from expected environmental change.

Historical analysis becomes especially important because many operational anomalies and suspicious behaviors only become visible when compared against long-term communication baselines rather than isolated real-time traffic snapshots.

## Common rare-flow indicators

| Indicator | Operational meaning |
|---|---|
| Previously unseen destination | New or unexpected communication target |
| Rare protocol activity | Unusual application or transport behavior |
| Unexpected timing behavior | Communication outside historical patterns |
| Low-frequency communication | Rarely observed traffic relationships |
| Cross-segment anomalies | Unusual communication between network zones |
| Behavioral deviation | Traffic differing significantly from baseline activity |

These indicators help analysts prioritize traffic investigation and behavioral-analysis workflows across large telemetry environments.

## What makes rare flows operationally effective

Operationally effective rare-flow analysis depends heavily on historical baselines, telemetry retention, behavioral context, scalable analytics, and long-term visibility into communication behavior across the environment.

Without sufficient historical telemetry, behavioral rarity becomes difficult to interpret accurately because systems cannot reliably distinguish between genuinely unusual activity and previously unobserved normal behavior.

Poor baselines, incomplete telemetry visibility, inconsistent retention, or missing environmental context can produce misleading anomaly indicators, excessive false positives, and incomplete operational visibility.

Rare-flow analysis becomes significantly more effective when correlated with asset context, authentication telemetry, application visibility, threat intelligence, and historical traffic behavior because isolated anomalies rarely provide enough operational meaning on their own.

As infrastructures scale, organizations increasingly rely on behavioral analytics and historical traffic visibility to understand how communication patterns evolve over time across enterprise, ISP, telecom, broadband, cloud, and distributed environments.

Rare-flow analysis therefore functions as a behavioral visibility mechanism that helps operators identify operational changes, unexpected communication patterns, and emerging anomalies across large traffic environments.

## In Trisul

Trisul Network Analytics helps operations and security teams analyze rare flows using behavioral traffic analytics, historical traffic visibility, conversation analysis, anomaly investigation workflows, flow-based telemetry analytics, and long-term operational correlation across distributed environments.

Using NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, packet analysis, and historical traffic telemetry, Trisul helps organizations investigate previously unseen communication behavior, analyze abnormal protocol activity, identify unusual destinations and traffic relationships, correlate behavioral anomalies with operational events, and maintain historical visibility into evolving traffic patterns across enterprise, ISP, telecom, broadband, and cloud infrastructures.

Trisul also helps operators investigate intermittent anomalies, analyze changing communication baselines, correlate unusual traffic behavior with application activity and operational changes, and maintain searchable historical visibility into behavioral traffic deviations over extended periods of time.

This becomes especially valuable in environments where operational visibility depends heavily on understanding how communication behavior changes relative to established historical traffic baselines.
