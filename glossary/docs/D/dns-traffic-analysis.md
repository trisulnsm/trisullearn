# What is DNS traffic analysis?

**DNS traffic analysis** examines DNS queries and responses to understand domain‑resolution behavior, detect security threats, identify anomalous activity, and analyze network communications at the DNS layer. It focuses on what domains devices are resolving, what types of records are requested, and how often, rather than just IP‑level flows. This gives deeper visibility into application and malware activity that often first appears in DNS.

---

## How DNS traffic analysis works

DNS traffic analysis inspects DNS‑layer traffic by parsing queries and responses. It looks at query names, query types, response codes, record types, and timing patterns. This can be done via packet capture, DNS‑aware flow exporters, or passive DNS collection. Analysts then look for unusual query volumes, suspicious domains, odd record‑type mixes, or high‑rate lookups that might indicate malware or tunneling. Correlating DNS with IP flows improves detection and context.

---

## What DNS traffic analysis can detect

DNS analysis helps spot anomalies that may indicate compromise or misconfiguration. Common patterns include DNS tunneling (data exfiltration through queries), fast‑flux infrastructure (rapidly changing IPs behind domains), malicious‑domain communication, DNS amplification, and query storms from malware or misconfigured services. High error counts or failed lookups can also reveal problems in DNS infrastructure or application behavior. DNS‑based threat hunting often uses these clues as early signals.

---

## DNS traffic analysis in network operations

In operations, DNS analysis supports security, troubleshooting, and performance monitoring. Security teams use it for threat hunting, incident response, and malware investigations, often tying DNS activity to endpoint or firewall logs. Network teams use it to debug resolution problems, latency, and intermittent connectivity. ISPs and MSPs analyze DNS for abuse detection and policy enforcement. Because nearly all services depend on DNS, this layer is a rich source of behavioral context.

---

## DNS traffic analysis vs flow monitoring

DNS traffic analysis and flow monitoring are complementary. **Flow monitoring** tracks IP‑level flows (addresses, ports, bytes, packets, timestamps), giving broad traffic‑behavior visibility. **DNS analysis** drills into domain‑level behavior: what domains are queried, which records are returned, and how often. Together they let operators see both “who is talking to whom on which ports” and “which domains those services depend on or abuse.”

---

## What is passive DNS?

**Passive DNS** passively observes and records DNS queries and responses from real network traffic, storing mappings between domains and IPs over time. This historical view helps investigators track when domains changed IPs, spot fast‑flux activity, or reconstruct campaigns. Passive DNS depends on where you monitor (for example, internal resolvers vs ISP upstream) and how long you retain the data.

---

## DNS transport and modern protocols

Traditional DNS uses **UDP port 53** for most queries and **TCP port 53** for large responses and zone transfers. DNSSEC and some modern services also use TCP. Newer encrypted protocols like **DNS‑over‑TLS (DoT)** and **DNS‑over‑HTTPS (DoH)** protect privacy by wrapping DNS in TLS or HTTPS, but they can reduce visibility for plain‑text DNS monitoring unless you decrypt or otherwise inspect the traffic.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports DNS‑oriented analysis by combining flow and packet visibility. When DNS traffic is captured or logged, Trisul can show top‑talkers by domain‑like flows, correlate suspicious IPs with DNS lookups, and let analysts drill down in **Explore Flows**. Historical trending and **Top‑K analytics** help highlight changes in DNS query patterns or sudden spikes tied to specific hosts or prefixes. Trisul acts as a visibility platform that complements dedicated DNS security or passive‑DNS systems.

## Frequently asked questions

### What threats can DNS traffic analysis detect?

DNS traffic analysis can help identify suspicious domain lookups, DNS tunneling behavior, fast‑flux infrastructure, malicious‑domain communication, amplification activity, abnormal query patterns, and other DNS‑related security anomalies.

### How does DNS traffic analysis differ from flow monitoring?

Flow monitoring primarily analyzes traffic metadata such as IP addresses, ports, byte counts, and timing, while DNS traffic analysis examines DNS queries, responses, record types, and domain‑level activity for deeper application‑layer visibility.

### What is passive DNS?

Passive DNS is a method of collecting and storing observed DNS query and response data from network traffic to analyze historical domain‑to‑IP relationships and DNS activity patterns.

### Where does DNS traffic run?

Traditional DNS commonly uses UDP port 53 for most queries and TCP port 53 for larger responses, zone transfers, and some DNSSEC operations. Modern encrypted DNS technologies may also use HTTPS or TLS‑based transports.

### How does Trisul support DNS traffic analysis?

Trisul supports DNS‑oriented traffic analysis through flow analytics, packet visibility, traffic investigation workflows, and historical traffic analysis that help operators investigate DNS behavior and suspicious traffic patterns.
