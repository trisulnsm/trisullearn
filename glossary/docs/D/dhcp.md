# What is DHCP?

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** is a client‑server protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and related network configuration parameters to devices on an IP network. It is widely used in enterprises, ISPs, Wi‑Fi, datacenters, and home networks so that endpoints do not need to be configured manually. DHCP typically handles IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, DNS servers, and lease durations.

---

## How DHCP works

DHCP follows a client‑server model where a DHCP server maintains pools (scopes) of IP addresses and configuration options. When a device boots or connects, it sends a **Discover** message looking for DHCP servers. A server responds with an **Offer**, the client sends a **Request** for that offer, and the server replies with an **Acknowledge** confirming the lease. This four‑step process (DORA) temporarily assigns an IP address and network settings, after which the client can renew or release the lease when needed.

## DHCP in network operations

DHCP is a core operational tool for IP address management. It simplifies device onboarding, prevents IP conflicts, and supports mobility and large‑scale deployments. Network and security teams also use DHCP lease logs to correlate IP addresses with devices over time, which is especially useful for troubleshooting and forensic investigations. Lease history helps operators understand which devices used which IPs at what times.

## Common DHCP concepts

| Concept       | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| Lease         | Temporary IP assignment to a client |
| Scope         | Pool of IP addresses available for DHCP |
| Reservation   | Fixed IP assignment tied to a specific device |
| Renewal       | Extension of an existing lease |
| Relay agent   | Device that forwards DHCP messages between subnets |
| DHCP option   | Additional configuration (for example, NTP server, domain name) |

Different environments may customize scopes, lease times, and options to match their policies.

## DHCP vs static IP addressing

| Dimension               | DHCP                            | Static addressing                      |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Assignment method       | Automatic                       | Manual                                 |
| Operational overhead    | Lower                           | Higher                                 |
| Flexibility             | Dynamic and adaptable           | Fixed per host                         |
| Scalability             | High in large environments      | Lower and more labor‑intensive         |
| Typical use             | Endpoints and mobile devices    | Servers, network infrastructure        |

Static addressing is preferred for critical infrastructure, while DHCP dominates for users and transient devices.

## Why DHCP is useful

DHCP reduces manual configuration, avoids misconfiguration, and allows efficient reuse of IP addresses. It speeds up onboarding, supports devices that move between networks, and provides centralized control over IP assignments. In large environments, dynamic leases simplify management and make it easier to scale the network as the number of devices increases.

## In Trisul

Trisul is not a DHCP server, but it can use DHCP‑related information during operational and security workflows. When DHCP logs, client‑ID mappings, or other address‑assignment context is available, Trisul can use that data to correlate IP addresses with devices, reconstruct historical address usage, and enhance traffic‑attribution and host‑oriented analysis. This helps operators link traffic to specific devices and understand how address reuse affects security and compliance scenarios.
