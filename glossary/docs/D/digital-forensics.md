# What is digital forensics?

**Digital forensics** is the practice of collecting, preserving, analyzing, and documenting digital evidence to reconstruct events and support operational, security, compliance, or legal investigations. It is used in cybersecurity, incident response, insider‑threat analysis, compliance audits, and legal cases to understand what happened, when, and how. Evidence can come from network traffic, logs, files, memory, and authentication systems.

## How digital forensics works

Digital forensics follows a structured workflow that focuses on preserving evidence and documenting every step. Investigators first identify where relevant evidence exists (for example, packet captures, logs, or endpoint images). They then collect the data using controlled procedures, store it securely, and analyze it to reconstruct timelines and activities. Multiple sources are correlated, findings are documented, and results are presented for operational or legal use. Chain‑of‑custody, integrity checks, and clear documentation are central to the process.

## Digital forensics in network operations

In security and operations, digital forensics helps reconstruct breaches, misconfigurations, or performance‑impacting incidents. Teams use it to understand attack timelines, identify malicious traffic, and validate or disprove hypotheses. Network‑centric workflows often leverage flow records, packet captures, logs, and authentication history to build a timeline of events across systems. This visibility is critical for post‑incident reports, regulatory audits, and legal proceedings.

## Common forensic evidence sources

| Source               | Use |
|----------------------|-----|
| Logs                 | Event and timestamp reconstruction |
| Packet captures      | Detailed communication evidence |
| Flow records         | Session‑level traffic behavior |
| Filesystems          | File creation, modification, and access |
| Memory captures      | Process and runtime analysis |
| Authentication records| User and session context |
| System artifacts     | Registry, registry‑like data, and host state |

Investigations often combine network and endpoint sources to build a complete picture.

## Network forensics vs endpoint forensics

| Dimension          | Network forensics                      | Endpoint forensics                         |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Focus              | Traffic and communications             | Device‑level activity                      |
| Main evidence      | Packets, flows, logs                   | Files, memory, processes, registry         |
| Operational view   | Cross‑host traffic patterns            | Detailed host‑specific behavior            |
| Typical use        | Communications reconstruction          | Malware and local‑profile analysis        |

Effective investigations often tie both together for a full picture of what happened.

## Why digital forensics matters

Digital forensics turns raw data into legally and operationally defensible findings. It helps teams understand incident scope, reconstruct sequences of events, and improve defenses. Without proper handling, evidence can be challenged or dismissed. Historical traffic visibility, accurate timestamps, and preserved logs are particularly important for network‑oriented investigations and regulatory or court‑driven reviews.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports network‑oriented digital forensics through long‑retained flow and, when available, packet‑level visibility. Using NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, and related telemetry, Trisul lets investigators reconstruct traffic patterns, timelines, and communication flows around specific hosts, prefixes, or time windows. With **Explore Flows**, **Aggregate Flows**, and historical trending, Trisul can help trace suspicious activity, correlate traffic across interfaces, and support incident‑response and compliance workflows. Trisul is a network‑analytics and traffic‑visibility platform and is typically used alongside endpoint‑forensics and case‑management tools.
