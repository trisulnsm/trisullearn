# What is DDoS detection?

**DDoS detection** is the process of identifying distributed denial‑of‑service attacks by monitoring traffic patterns, volume anomalies, and protocol behavior associated with malicious flood traffic targeting networks, services, or applications. Rather than protecting traffic directly, detection focuses on spotting unusual or overloaded traffic conditions that suggest an attack is in progress. It is a core component of network security and incident‑response strategies.

---

## How DDoS detection works

DDoS detection systems continuously monitor traffic and build a baseline of normal behavior. When traffic volume, packet rates, or protocol patterns deviate from that baseline—such as a sudden spike in requests or a surge in SYN packets—the system flags it as suspicious. Detection can be done inline (in the forwarding path) or out‑of‑band using flow telemetry or mirrored packets. Alarms and dashboards then alert operators so they can investigate and trigger mitigation.

---

## Common DDoS attack indicators

Looked for signs of DDoS include rapid traffic spikes, abnormal protocol or port distributions, excessive SYN or DNS requests, and traffic from many unexpected or spoofed sources. Operators also watch for increased packet rates, high retransmissions, and service degradation such as timeouts or rising latency. No single indicator is conclusive; detection is most reliable when multiple anomalies occur together.

---

## Types of DDoS attacks

DDoS attacks are commonly grouped into three categories. **Volumetric attacks** flood the network with traffic to saturate bandwidth. **Protocol attacks** exhaust server or firewall resources with malformed or resource‑heavy packets (for example, SYN floods). **Application‑layer attacks** target specific services with high‑rate HTTP or DNS queries that appear more benign but still exhaust server capacity. Examples include UDP floods, ICMP floods, DNS amplification, and HTTP floods.

---

## Inline vs out‑of‑band DDoS detection

Inline detection runs directly in the forwarding path and can inspect and block traffic in real time, but it may add latency and must scale with traffic volume. Out‑of‑band detection analyzes mirrored packets or flow telemetry without touching the live path, so it does not affect performance but relies on external systems to actually mitigate attacks. Many environments use both: out‑of‑band monitoring for visibility and inline tools for active blocking.

---

## DDoS detection in network operations

In SOC, ISP, and enterprise environments, DDoS detection is used to detect attacks early, reduce service impact, and coordinate mitigation. It helps operators distinguish between legitimate traffic surges and malicious floods, investigate the scope of an attack, and verify that scrubbing or rate‑limiting measures are working. Historical trending also helps tune detection thresholds and tune baselines over time.

---

## Why DDoS detection matters

DDoS attacks can cause service outages, high latency, and resource exhaustion, affecting many users at once. Effective detection reduces incident‑response time, improves operational awareness, and supports mitigation workflows. Traffic analytics and anomaly‑detection dashboards make it easier to see when something is wrong and what is being targeted, especially in large or complex networks.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports DDoS‑oriented detection and investigation through flow‑based traffic analytics. Using NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, and related telemetry, it can highlight sudden spikes, top‑talker shifts, and abnormal protocol patterns. With **Top‑K analytics**, **historical trending**, threshold‑based alerts, and **Explore Flows**, Trisul helps operators quickly see traffic anomalies, drill into affected prefixes or hosts, and support broader DDoS‑mitigation workflows. Trisul is primarily an analytics and visibility platform and works best when paired with dedicated DDoS‑mitigation hardware or scrubbing services.

## Frequently asked questions

### What are the indicators of a DDoS attack?

Indicators of DDoS activity include sudden traffic spikes, abnormal protocol distributions, excessive connection attempts, SYN floods, unusual source distribution patterns, increased packet rates, service degradation, and sustained traffic anomalies.

### How does flow‑based DDoS detection work?

Flow‑based DDoS detection analyzes flow telemetry such as NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, or J‑Flow to identify traffic anomalies, volumetric spikes, protocol irregularities, and abnormal traffic distribution patterns associated with attack activity.

### What is the difference between inline and out‑of‑band DDoS detection?

Inline detection systems directly inspect traffic in the forwarding path and may support immediate mitigation, while out‑of‑band systems analyze mirrored packets or flow telemetry passively without sitting directly in the traffic path.

### What types of DDoS attacks can be detected?

Detection workflows can identify volumetric attacks, protocol attacks, and application‑layer attacks including UDP floods, ICMP floods, SYN floods, DNS amplification, HTTP floods, and traffic reflection attacks.

### How does Trisul support DDoS detection workflows?

Trisul supports DDoS detection workflows through flow analytics, anomaly‑oriented traffic visibility, Top‑K analysis, threshold‑based alerting, and operational investigation workflows.
