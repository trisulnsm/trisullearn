# What is DoT Compliance?

**DoT Compliance** refers to adherence to regulatory requirements issued by India’s **Department of Telecommunications (DoT)**, especially around lawful interception, subscriber traceability, traffic logging, and **Internet Protocol Detail Record (IPDR)** retention for licensed telecom and ISP operators. It is a core set of obligations for ISPs, broadband providers, and network operators that manage dynamic IP and NAT infrastructures in India.

---

## What DoT Compliance requires

DoT‑related rules generally require operators to retain traffic and subscriber‑related metadata so authorized entities can carry out lawful‑interception and investigative work. Operators must maintain NAT mappings, session logs, and subscriber associations over defined retention periods. Typical data elements include timestamps, source and destination IP addresses, ports, NAT translation details, subscriber or AAA identifiers, device names, and session‑level metadata needed to trace which user used which IP at what time.

---

## Why IPDR retention matters

In Indian ISP environments, many users share public IP addresses via **CGNAT** and **dynamic addressing**, so raw IP logs alone cannot identify who generated traffic. IPDR retention solves this by storing the mapping between users, internal IPs, and public IP/port tuples. This traceability is essential for lawful‑interception orders, abuse investigations, and audit‑ready reporting when the DoT or law‑enforcement agencies request subscriber‑level details.

---

## DoT compliance in network operations

For ISPs and telecom operators, DoT compliance shapes how traffic and flows are collected and stored. Operators use flow‑monitoring and analytics systems to capture IPDR‑style records at routers, firewalls, and NAT gateways, then retain them for mandated periods. Common workflows include subscriber traceability queries, NAT‑mapping investigations, historical traffic lookups, and regulatory reporting. Platforms must handle high‑volume ingestion, long‑term retention, and fast historical queries under production loads.

## IPDR logging vs flow monitoring

| Aspect                   | IPDR logging                                 | Flow monitoring                             |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Main purpose             | Regulatory traceability and LI readiness     | Network operations and analytics            |
| Data scope               | Compliance‑oriented metadata                 | General traffic visibility and metrics      |
| Retention emphasis       | Long‑term retention for audits               | Operational analytics retention             |
| Primary users            | Regulators, auditors, LI teams              | NOC, SOC, operations                        |
| Operational focus        | Traceability and investigations              | Performance, security, troubleshooting      |

IPDR workflows usually run on top of flow‑monitoring infrastructure, but they are tuned for regulatory rather than just operational needs.

## Operational considerations for IPDR environments

Large‑scale IPDR deployments require high‑volume ingestion, accurate NAT correlation, and efficient storage layouts. Operators must keep time‑sync stable, validate subscriber mappings, and design access controls for protected data. They also need to plan for query performance when investigating specific time ranges, IPs, or user IDs. Misconfiguration or clock drift can break forensic traceability and cause compliance risk.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports DoT‑compliance workflows by providing scalable flow‑based IPDR‑style visibility. Using **NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow**, and NAT‑aware exporters, Trisul can capture and retain per‑session flow metadata at ISP scale. Features like **NAT‑aware traffic views**, long‑term **historical flow retention**, and **Explore Flows** let operators reconstruct which user used which IP at a given time, query by subscriber, and support traceability and abuse investigations. Trisul acts as a traffic‑analytics layer that feeds compliant logging and reporting systems rather than as a standalone LI‑compliant appliance.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is the DoT IPDR mandate?

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) requires licensed ISP operators in India to retain Internet Protocol Detail Record (IPDR) logs for lawful interception, subscriber traceability, and regulatory compliance workflows. Operators must retain sufficient network activity records to support authorized investigations and audit requirements.

### What data elements are commonly required for IPDR compliance?

Common IPDR‑related data elements include timestamps, source and destination IP addresses, ports, NAT translation details, subscriber or AAA identifiers, router or device identifiers, and related traffic‑session metadata required for subscriber traceability.

### Why is IPDR retention important?

IPDR retention supports lawful interception, subscriber attribution, operational investigations, audit workflows, and compliance requirements in environments using dynamic IP addressing and NAT technologies.

### How does flow monitoring support DoT compliance?

Flow monitoring supports DoT compliance by collecting and retaining network flow metadata from routers, switches, firewalls, NAT devices, and AAA systems to support subscriber traceability, operational investigation, and regulatory retention workflows.

### How does Trisul support DoT compliance workflows?

Trisul supports IPDR‑oriented operational workflows through flow analytics, NAT correlation visibility, historical flow retention, and large‑scale traffic analytics capabilities suitable for ISP and telecom monitoring environments.
