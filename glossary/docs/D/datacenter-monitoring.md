# What is datacenter monitoring?

**Datacenter monitoring** is the process of observing the health, performance, availability, and traffic behavior of infrastructure, applications, and services inside a datacenter. It covers network devices, servers, storage, virtualization platforms, and the traffic between them. The goal is to keep services available, detect problems early, and understand usage patterns across the datacenter.

---

## How datacenter monitoring works

Datacenter monitoring collects telemetry from devices, systems, and applications. Common sources include SNMP, flow telemetry, system logs, application metrics, hypervisor counters, and environmental sensors. This data is aggregated, normalized, and correlated so operators can see availability, resource usage, and traffic patterns from a single view. Alerts and dashboards surface issues, while historical trending helps with capacity planning and troubleshooting.

---

## Datacenter monitoring in operations

In operations, datacenter monitoring is used for availability, performance, and capacity management. Operators use it to detect outages, investigate latency, understand traffic patterns (east‑west and north‑south), and validate virtualization and storage behavior. Because many services share the same infrastructure, monitoring is critical for quickly isolating failures and avoiding cascading impact across applications and tenants.

## Common datacenter telemetry signals

| Signal               | Purpose |
|----------------------|---------|
| Device health        | Uptime and state of routers, switches, firewalls |
| Link utilization     | Network load and traffic volume |
| Storage utilization  | Disk and storage usage |
| Application health   | Service availability and responsiveness |
| CPU and memory usage | Server resource consumption |
| Flow telemetry       | Traffic and communication visibility |
| Environmental metrics| Temperature, power, and cooling status |

Different teams (network, server, storage, cloud) focus on different signals but often share the same monitoring infrastructure.

## Datacenter monitoring vs cloud monitoring

| Dimension              | Datacenter monitoring                          | Cloud monitoring                                    |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Environment            | On‑premises or private datacenter             | Public or hybrid cloud services                    |
| Infrastructure control | Full control over physical and virtual systems| Shared control with cloud provider                 |
| Telemetry sources      | Direct device and system telemetry            | Cloud APIs and cloud‑native telemetry              |
| Operational focus      | Local infrastructure and applications         | Distributed cloud‑hosted services and microservices |

In practice, many organizations combine both into a hybrid monitoring strategy.

## Why datacenter monitoring matters

Datacenters host critical services, databases, and applications. Without monitoring, operators may miss congestion, overloaded links, failed servers, or storage exhaustion until users report issues. Effective monitoring improves uptime, reduces mean‑time‑to‑resolve, supports capacity planning, and helps teams understand how traffic and dependencies change over time. Traffic visibility is especially important in dense, high‑throughput environments.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports datacenter‑oriented monitoring through flow‑based traffic analytics and operational visibility. It ingests NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, and related telemetry to show east‑west and north‑south traffic, interface utilization, congestion, and top‑talker views. With **Top‑K analytics**, **Explore Flows**, and **historical traffic trending**, Trisul helps operators investigate traffic behavior, spot bottlenecks, and correlate performance issues across switches, routers, and servers in the datacenter.
