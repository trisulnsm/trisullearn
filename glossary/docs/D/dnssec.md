# What is DNSSEC?

**DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)** adds cryptographic authentication and integrity verification to DNS responses to protect against spoofing, tampering, and forged DNS data. Traditional DNS answers queries but gives no built‑in way to verify that the answer is genuine. DNSSEC fixes this by digitally signing DNS records so resolvers can confirm the data is authentic and unchanged.

---

## How DNSSEC works

DNSSEC uses public‑key cryptography to sign DNS records and validate them. A DNS zone is signed with a private key; the corresponding public key is published in **DNSKEY** records. Responses include **RRSIG** signatures that resolvers check along with **DS** (Delegation Signer) records to build a “chain of trust” from the root down to the target domain. If any signature fails to validate, the resolver can treat the response as invalid.

---

## DNSSEC in network operations

DNSSEC reduces the risk of DNS‑based attacks such as spoofed A records, poisoned DNS caches, and man‑in‑the‑middle manipulation of domain lookups. It is especially important for critical services, financial systems, and public infrastructure. Operators must manage signing keys, keep zones correctly signed, and ensure their resolvers support validation. Misconfigurations can cause resolution failures, so testing and monitoring are essential.

---

## DNSSEC vs encrypted DNS

DNSSEC and encrypted DNS solve different problems. **DNSSEC** protects the authenticity and integrity of DNS answers but does not encrypt traffic. **Encrypted DNS (DoT/DoH)** hides DNS query contents from observers but does not itself sign responses. In practice, many environments use DNSSEC plus encrypted DNS to get both integrity and confidentiality.

| Aspect                 | DNSSEC                             | Encrypted DNS (DoT/DoH)             |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Validates DNS records  | Yes                                | No                                   |
| Encrypts DNS traffic   | No                                 | Yes                                  |
| Prevents spoofing      | Yes (if validated)                | Limited effect alone                |
| Hides queries from ISP | No                                 | Yes                                  |

## DNSSEC‑related records

DNSSEC uses several special record types:

- **DNSKEY**: Holds the public keys that sign a zone.  
- **RRSIG**: Holds the digital signatures for sets of records.  
- **DS**: Links a child zone to a parent by signing the child’s public key.  
- **NSEC**/**NSEC3**: Provide authenticated denial of existence, proving that a domain does not exist.  

These records form the cryptographic backbone that resolvers use to validate DNSSEC‑signed responses.

---

## DNSSEC and traffic visibility

DNSSEC does not encrypt or hide DNS queries; it only signs responses. From a traffic‑analysis point of view, DNS queries and answers remain visible, though responses may be larger because of extra signature and key records. This means platforms that inspect DNS traffic can still see domain‑level activity while organizations also benefit from DNSSEC’s integrity checks.

---

## Why DNSSEC matters

Without DNSSEC, an attacker can forge DNS answers that redirect users to malicious servers (for example, fake banking sites) or poison caches to affect many users at once. DNSSEC makes this much harder because resolvers can detect tampered or spoofed responses. It is not a complete security solution—DNSSEC does not block malicious domains or hide queries—but it is a key layer that hardens the DNS‑resolution path.

## In Trisul

Trisul does not perform DNSSEC validation itself, but it can help monitor DNSSEC‑related traffic and diagnose issues. Flow‑based analytics show DNS traffic patterns, packet visibility lets you inspect DNS message sizes and record types, and **Explore Flows** helps trace DNS‑related spikes or anomalies. Trisul’s dashboards and historical trending can highlight when DNS‑related loads increase (for example, from bigger DNSSEC‑enabled responses) or when certain hosts show abnormal DNS behavior, making it easier to correlate DNSSEC‑related changes with operational or security events.
