# What is user analytics?

**User analytics** is the analysis of user activity, behavior, access patterns, and resource usage to understand how individuals or groups interact with applications, services, and network resources.

The primary value of user analytics is attribution. By associating activity with specific users or identities, organizations can understand who is responsible for observed behavior rather than viewing activity only as IP addresses, hosts, sessions, or network flows.

This additional context helps transform technical activity data into meaningful operational and security insights.

## Why is user analytics important?

Without identity context, operators may only see network activity, application sessions, or resource consumption without knowing who generated it.

User analytics bridges this gap by connecting activity to specific users, subscribers, accounts, or groups. This helps organizations understand application adoption, resource consumption, access behavior, usage trends, and changes in activity over time.

Because user behavior often drives network and application demand, user analytics also plays an important role in capacity planning, operational visibility, troubleshooting, and service optimization.

## User analytics in operations and security

Operations teams use user analytics to understand how services and resources are consumed, identify heavy users, analyze adoption trends, and align infrastructure planning with actual user demand.

Security teams use user analytics to investigate unusual access patterns, suspicious account activity, authentication anomalies, and behavioral changes that may indicate misuse or compromise.

In both cases, the value comes from understanding activity in the context of real users rather than isolated technical events.

## What makes user analytics useful?

User analytics is most effective when identity information can be correlated with network, application, authentication, and activity data.

Historical visibility is particularly important because behavioral changes often become meaningful only when compared against previous activity. By combining identity context with long-term activity trends, organizations can better understand how user behavior evolves over time and identify meaningful deviations from expected patterns.

## In Trisul

User analytics becomes significantly more valuable when identity information can be correlated with network activity and traffic behavior.

Trisul Network Analytics helps operators associate users, subscribers, hosts, and services with observed traffic activity, enabling deeper visibility into resource consumption, application usage, behavioral trends, and operational activity.

These workflows are particularly useful in enterprise and ISP environments where understanding user behavior, subscriber activity, and resource utilization is important for troubleshooting, reporting, security investigations, and operational visibility.
