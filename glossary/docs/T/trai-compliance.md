# What is TRAI compliance?

**TRAI compliance** refers to the ability of licensed telecom operators and ISPs in India to maintain the records, traceability, and reporting capabilities required by telecommunications regulations.

At its core, TRAI compliance is about maintaining enough historical information to reliably associate network activity with the subscriber responsible for it. This allows operators to support regulatory obligations, respond to lawful requests, and provide accurate records when required.

Compliance requirements vary based on license category, regulatory directives, and applicable government requirements.

## Why TRAI compliance matters

A central requirement of many compliance workflows is **subscriber traceability**.

Operators must be able to determine which subscriber was using a particular IP address, service, or network resource at a specific point in time. This capability is important for regulatory investigations, lawful information requests, operational accountability, and audit requirements.

As networks grow larger and subscriber counts increase, maintaining accurate historical records becomes critical to meeting these obligations.

## How TRAI compliance works

TRAI compliance is typically achieved through a combination of subscriber records, IP address assignment records, authentication logs, NAT logs, IPDR records, audit trails, and historical data retention.

These records allow operators to reconstruct network activity and associate it with the correct subscriber when required.

This becomes particularly important in environments using Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT), where many subscribers may share the same public IP address. In such cases, NAT logging and subscriber correlation are essential for accurately tracing network activity back to the correct user.

Effective compliance depends on maintaining accurate subscriber records, reliable timestamps, complete logging, and secure retention of historical data.

## In Trisul

TRAI compliance is directly relevant to Trisul deployments in ISP and telecom environments.

Trisul supports compliance-related workflows through IPDR generation, subscriber mapping, NAT logging and correlation, historical traffic retention, and investigative search capabilities. These functions help operators trace network activity to subscribers, reconstruct historical records, and respond to regulatory or lawful information requests.

These workflows are commonly used in ISP, broadband, CGNAT, and telecom environments where subscriber traceability is a key operational and regulatory requirement.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is TRAI compliance?

TRAI compliance refers to the ability of licensed telecom operators and ISPs in India to maintain the records, traceability, and reporting capabilities required by telecommunications regulations.

### Why is TRAI compliance important?

TRAI compliance helps operators maintain subscriber traceability, support lawful requests, meet regulatory obligations, and provide accurate historical records when required.

### What does TRAI compliance typically require?

Compliance commonly requires subscriber identification, IP address tracking, NAT traceability, record retention, audit support, and the ability to associate network activity with the correct subscriber.

### Why is subscriber traceability important?

Subscriber traceability allows operators to determine which subscriber was responsible for a particular network activity, IP address assignment, or service usage at a specific point in time.

### Why is NAT logging important for compliance?

When multiple subscribers share the same public IP address through CGNAT, NAT logs provide the information needed to identify the subscriber responsible for a specific connection or activity.

### How is TRAI compliance supported in analytics platforms?

Analytics platforms can support compliance workflows through IPDR generation, subscriber mapping, NAT correlation, historical record retention, audit trails, and search capabilities that help operators respond to regulatory requests efficiently.
