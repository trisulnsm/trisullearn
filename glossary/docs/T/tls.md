# What is TLS?

**TLS (Transport Layer Security)** is a cryptographic protocol that encrypts communication between systems to protect confidentiality, integrity, and authentication during data transmission.

TLS secures most modern internet and enterprise communication, including HTTPS traffic, APIs, cloud applications, authentication systems, messaging platforms, and business applications.

Operationally, TLS changes network visibility because encrypted payloads can no longer be inspected directly. This reduces traditional payload-based monitoring and increases the importance of metadata analysis, behavioral visibility, flow telemetry, TLS handshake analysis, JA3 fingerprints, certificate visibility, and DNS correlation.

Because encrypted traffic may contain both legitimate applications and malicious communication, operations and security teams rely on TLS metadata and traffic behavior to investigate suspicious activity, analyze encrypted traffic patterns, identify applications, and reconstruct operational activity across the network.

TLS therefore functions not only as a security protocol, but also as a major visibility shift that changes how modern traffic analysis, troubleshooting, and threat investigations are performed.

## How TLS works

TLS establishes an encrypted session between communicating systems before application data is exchanged.

During the TLS handshake, systems negotiate encryption parameters, validate certificates, and establish session keys used to secure communication. Once the session is established, application traffic becomes encrypted before transmission.

Modern environments commonly use TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, while older SSL and legacy TLS versions are generally considered insecure and deprecated.

## TLS in network operations

TLS is now present across most enterprise, cloud, ISP, broadband, and internet traffic environments.

While TLS protects communication from interception and tampering, it also reduces direct packet visibility. Analysts therefore investigate encrypted traffic using observable metadata such as flow behavior, TLS handshakes, JA3 fingerprints, certificate metadata, DNS activity, and communication patterns.

Encrypted-traffic visibility is especially important during threat investigations, application identification, behavioral analysis, incident response, and suspicious communication analysis because payload inspection alone is no longer sufficient in heavily encrypted environments.

## In Trisul

Encrypted-traffic investigations often require historical visibility because payload inspection alone cannot fully explain suspicious communication behavior retrospectively.

Trisul Network Analytics helps analysts investigate encrypted traffic using flow analytics, TLS metadata visibility, JA3 correlation, historical traffic analysis, and flow-to-packet investigative workflows across distributed infrastructures.

These workflows help operations and security teams analyze encrypted traffic behavior, investigate abnormal TLS activity, correlate JA3 fingerprints with traffic patterns, and maintain searchable visibility into encrypted communication across enterprise, ISP, broadband, telecom, and cloud environments.

For encrypted-traffic analytics and flow investigation workflows, see the Trisul documentation:
