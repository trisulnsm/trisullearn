# What is trend analysis?

**Trend analysis** is the study of how network and performance metrics change over time. It helps operators identify growth patterns, recurring behavior, anomalies, and long-term operational changes.

Rather than focusing on a single measurement, trend analysis examines historical data across hours, days, weeks, months, or years to understand how network behavior evolves.

A single measurement shows the current state of a system. A trend reveals whether conditions are improving, deteriorating, remaining stable, or changing in unexpected ways.

## How trend analysis works

Trend analysis is based on time-series data collected at regular intervals.

By comparing measurements over time, operators can identify growth, decline, seasonality, recurring peaks, long-term behavioral shifts, and anomalies that may not be visible from individual observations.

For example, a single utilization reading shows the current state of a link, while a utilization trend reveals whether traffic demand is increasing, stable, or approaching capacity limits.

As more historical data becomes available, trends become easier to interpret and more valuable for long-term decision-making.

## Why trend analysis matters

Network behavior is rarely static. Traffic volumes, application usage, subscriber activity, and infrastructure utilization often change gradually over time.

Trend analysis helps distinguish temporary fluctuations from meaningful long-term changes. By comparing current activity with historical patterns, operators can determine whether observed behavior is normal, unusual, or part of an ongoing trend.

This visibility supports troubleshooting, operational planning, infrastructure investments, and performance management.

Trend analysis is also widely used for forecasting because historical growth patterns often provide insight into future capacity requirements and operational needs.

## Common trend analysis examples

| Metric | Typical question |
|---|---|
| Bandwidth utilization | Is traffic growing over time? |
| Latency | Is application performance degrading? |
| Interface utilization | Is the link approaching saturation? |
| Session count | Is network activity increasing? |
| Application usage | Are usage patterns changing? |

The value of trend analysis depends on having consistent measurements, reliable timestamps, and sufficient historical data for comparison.

## Baselines and anomaly detection

Historical baselines provide context by showing what normal behavior looks like.

Without a baseline, it is difficult to determine whether a traffic increase, utilization spike, or performance change is expected or abnormal. Trend analysis helps establish these baselines and makes it easier to identify meaningful deviations from normal behavior.

This is why trend analysis is often used alongside anomaly detection, performance monitoring, and capacity-planning workflows.

## In Trisul

Trend analysis is a core capability in Trisul Network Analytics.

By maintaining long-term historical telemetry, Trisul enables operators to distinguish temporary events from sustained changes, identify recurring patterns, compare current activity with historical behavior, and understand how network conditions evolve over time.

These capabilities support capacity planning, traffic engineering, performance monitoring, operational reporting, and investigations where historical context is required to determine whether observed behavior is normal, recurring, or anomalous.
