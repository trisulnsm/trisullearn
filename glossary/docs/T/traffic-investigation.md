# What is traffic investigation?

**Traffic investigation** is the process of analyzing network traffic to determine the cause, scope, and impact of a security incident, performance issue, or unusual network behavior.

At its core, traffic investigation is about reconstructing network events from evidence. By examining how systems communicated, when activity occurred, and how traffic moved through the network, investigators can determine what happened and identify the root cause of an issue.

Traffic investigation is widely used in troubleshooting, incident response, security analysis, and network forensics.

## Why traffic investigation matters

Network traffic provides direct evidence of communication between systems, making it one of the most valuable sources of information during an investigation.

Whether the goal is to understand suspicious activity, troubleshoot an application problem, investigate a performance issue, or validate a security alert, traffic investigation helps teams identify affected systems, determine the scope of an event, and understand how it unfolded across the network.

By turning raw telemetry into evidence, traffic investigation helps move investigations from assumptions to facts.

## How traffic investigation works

Most investigations begin with an alert, anomaly, user complaint, or observed symptom.

Investigators search traffic data using attributes such as IP addresses, ports, protocols, applications, and time ranges. Flow records provide a broad view of communication patterns and traffic behavior, while packet captures provide protocol-level detail when deeper analysis is required.

Traffic data is often correlated with logs, alerts, DNS activity, authentication records, and other telemetry sources to build a complete picture of an event and identify its root cause.

## In Trisul

Traffic investigation is a core workflow in Trisul Network Analytics.

Trisul enables analysts to search historical traffic, examine conversations, correlate activity across telemetry sources, and move from flow-level visibility to packet-level analysis when packet data is available. This helps accelerate troubleshooting, incident investigation, security analysis, and network-forensics workflows.

Additional traffic-investigation workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:
