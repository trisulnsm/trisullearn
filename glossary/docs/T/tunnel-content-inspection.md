# What is tunnel content inspection?

**Tunnel content inspection** is the process of analyzing traffic carried inside network tunnels by decoding encapsulation protocols and examining the underlying communications.

Network tunnels encapsulate one protocol inside another, allowing traffic to traverse networks using an outer transport layer. While the tunnel headers reveal information about the tunnel itself, they often provide limited visibility into the actual hosts, applications, and conversations being transported.

Tunnel content inspection restores this visibility by exposing the communications carried inside the tunnel. This allows operators to understand how tunneled traffic is being used, identify the systems involved, and analyze the traffic patterns hidden behind encapsulation.

## Why is tunnel content inspection important?

Without inspection, operators may only see tunnel endpoints and aggregate traffic volumes. This makes it difficult to determine which applications are active, which hosts are communicating, or how tunneled traffic is affecting network behavior.

Tunnel content inspection improves traffic attribution by revealing the inner communications carried within the tunnel. This additional context is valuable for troubleshooting, traffic analysis, capacity planning, application visibility, and security investigations.

Not every tunnel requires inspection, but in environments that rely heavily on overlays, VPNs, carrier networks, mobile infrastructure, or virtualized networking, visibility into encapsulated traffic is often essential.

## Tunnel content inspection in network operations

Tunnel inspection is commonly used to investigate tunneled services, analyze overlay networks, validate expected tunnel usage, troubleshoot performance problems, and understand how traffic is distributed across encapsulated environments.

Security teams also use tunnel inspection to improve visibility into communications that would otherwise be hidden behind tunnel endpoints and to investigate unusual or unexpected traffic behavior.

The effectiveness of tunnel inspection depends on the tunnel protocol, observation point, and whether the encapsulated traffic remains accessible after decapsulation. Encrypted tunnels may still limit visibility into payload content even when the tunnel itself can be identified.

## In Trisul

Tunnel content inspection is particularly valuable when operators need visibility beyond tunnel endpoints.

Trisul Network Analytics can decode and analyze supported tunneling and encapsulation protocols, helping operators investigate the hosts, applications, conversations, and traffic patterns carried inside tunneled traffic.

By combining packet analysis, flow analytics, historical traffic visibility, and protocol decoding, Trisul helps network and security teams understand how encapsulated traffic behaves and how it affects overall network operations.

These workflows are commonly used in environments that rely on GRE, VXLAN, GTP, carrier transport networks, overlay architectures, and other encapsulation technologies.

For protocol visibility and traffic-analysis workflows, see the Trisul documentation:
