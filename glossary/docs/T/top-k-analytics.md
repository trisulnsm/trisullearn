# What is Top-K Analyticsᵀ?

**Top-K Analyticsᵀ** is Trisul's proprietary technology for efficiently computing top-N rankings from large-scale flow data using ingestion-time stream summaries instead of expensive query-time scans.

It is used to identify top traffic consumers such as:
- Top talkers
- Top applications
- Top conversations
- Top destinations
- Top protocols

In networking, **K** refers to the highest-ranked items in a dataset, such as the top 10 hosts by bandwidth or top 100 applications by traffic volume.

Top-K Analyticsᵀ is designed for environments where flow archives may contain millions or billions of records.

---

## Why Top-K analytics matters

In large flow archives, identifying top traffic consumers normally requires scanning and sorting massive numbers of flow records.

As datasets grow, repeated query-time scans become computationally expensive and can slow dashboards, investigations, and historical analysis.

Top-K systems improve scalability by continuously maintaining summaries as traffic data is ingested instead of recalculating rankings from raw records during every query.

This shifts computation from query time to write time.

As a result, systems can retrieve top-N rankings quickly even across very large historical datasets.

---

## How Top-K Analyticsᵀ works

Top-K Analyticsᵀ continuously maintains stream summaries while flow data is ingested.

Instead of storing and sorting every individual flow during queries, the system updates compact ranking summaries incrementally as traffic arrives.

Queries retrieve these summaries directly without repeatedly scanning raw flow archives.

This approach is especially useful for:
- Large historical datasets
- Real-time dashboards
- High-ingestion environments
- Continuous traffic monitoring
- Long-term flow retention

Stream-summary algorithms reduce memory usage while preserving reasonably accurate rankings for high-volume traffic analysis.

The architecture is optimized for fast ranking queries across large-scale telemetry environments.

## Common Top-K analytics use cases

| Use case | Example |
|---|---|
| Top talkers | Highest-bandwidth hosts |
| Top applications | Most active applications |
| Top conversations | Largest source-destination pairs |
| Top ASN | Highest-volume autonomous systems |
| Top countries | Geographic traffic rankings |
| Historical rankings | Top traffic across past time periods |

Actual Top-K calculations depend on grouping logic, ranking criteria, telemetry type, and retention strategy.

## Top-K Analyticsᵀ in network analysis

Top-K analytics is commonly used for bandwidth monitoring, traffic analysis, anomaly detection, capacity planning, troubleshooting, and security investigations.

Teams commonly investigate:
- Unexpected bandwidth spikes
- High-volume hosts
- Dominant applications
- Traffic concentration
- Large external transfers
- Abnormal traffic growth
- DDoS traffic patterns

Because Top-K rankings summarize dominant traffic behavior quickly, they are useful for both real-time visibility and historical investigations.

Top-K visibility is often combined with flow telemetry, packet analysis, historical traffic analysis, and behavioral analytics to investigate unusual traffic activity.

## How Trisul uses Top-K Analyticsᵀ

Trisul implements Top-K Analyticsᵀ using ingestion-time stream summaries and write-time aggregation techniques.

Top-N rankings for hosts, destinations, conversations, applications, ASN, countries, ports, and custom traffic groupings are continuously maintained as flow data is written.

This allows Trisul to retrieve ranking information quickly without repeatedly scanning massive historical flow archives.

Top-K Analyticsᵀ supports dashboards, historical analysis, traffic investigations, and large-scale flow visibility across enterprise, ISP, telecom, cloud, and security-monitoring environments.

Additional Top-K and flow-analysis workflows are documented in the Trisul documentation:
