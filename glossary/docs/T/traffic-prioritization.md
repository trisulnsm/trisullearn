# What is traffic prioritization?

**Traffic prioritization** is the process of assigning different levels of service to network traffic so critical applications receive preferential treatment when network resources become constrained.

When sufficient bandwidth is available, most applications can coexist without issue. During periods of congestion, however, applications compete for limited network resources. Traffic prioritization helps ensure that important traffic continues to perform acceptably by allocating available bandwidth according to application requirements and business priorities.

Traffic prioritization is a fundamental component of **Quality of Service (QoS)** and is widely used to protect latency-sensitive applications such as voice, video conferencing, and critical business systems.

## Why traffic prioritization matters

Not all traffic has the same performance requirements.

A voice call may become unusable with only a small amount of delay or jitter, while a file transfer can often tolerate temporary slowdowns without affecting the user experience. Traffic prioritization recognizes these differences and allocates resources accordingly.

Rather than making traffic inherently faster, prioritization determines which applications are least affected when congestion occurs. This helps maintain application performance, improve user experience, and ensure that critical services remain available during periods of heavy utilization.

Because prioritization is based on tradeoffs, giving one traffic class higher priority typically means another class receives lower priority. Effective QoS policies balance these competing requirements without unnecessarily degrading lower-priority services.

## How traffic prioritization works

Traffic prioritization begins by classifying traffic into categories based on characteristics such as applications, protocols, users, devices, or business policies.

Once traffic is classified, network devices apply Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms that determine how each traffic class is treated during contention. Higher-priority traffic is typically serviced before lower-priority traffic, helping reduce latency, jitter, and packet loss for applications that are most sensitive to network conditions.

Common examples include prioritizing voice, video conferencing, interactive applications, and critical business services ahead of bulk transfers, backups, software updates, or other background activity.

## In Trisul

Trisul does not perform traffic prioritization or QoS enforcement. However, it helps operators understand the traffic patterns that influence QoS and traffic-engineering decisions.

Using flow analytics, application visibility, interface monitoring, and traffic analysis, operators can identify bandwidth-consuming applications, analyze traffic distribution, monitor congestion patterns, validate the effectiveness of QoS policies, and investigate application-performance issues.

These capabilities are useful when planning, validating, or troubleshooting traffic-prioritization strategies across enterprise, ISP, WAN, and cloud environments.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is traffic prioritization?

Traffic prioritization is the process of assigning different levels of service to network traffic so critical applications receive preferential treatment when network resources become constrained.

### Why is traffic prioritization used?

Traffic prioritization is used to protect latency-sensitive and business-critical applications during periods of congestion by allocating limited network resources according to application requirements and business priorities.

### How does traffic prioritization work?

Traffic prioritization works by classifying traffic and applying Quality of Service (QoS) policies that determine how different traffic classes are handled when bandwidth becomes limited.

### Does traffic prioritization make traffic faster?

Not necessarily. Traffic prioritization is primarily designed to ensure that important applications experience less delay, jitter, and packet loss during congestion rather than increasing overall network speed.

### What types of traffic are commonly prioritized?

Voice, video conferencing, interactive applications, and critical business services are commonly prioritized because they are more sensitive to latency and packet loss than bulk transfers or background traffic.

### What are the risks of poor prioritization policies?

Poorly designed policies can misclassify applications, create unfair resource allocation, or cause lower-priority traffic to experience excessive degradation during congestion.
