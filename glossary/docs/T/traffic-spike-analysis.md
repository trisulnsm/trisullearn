# What is traffic spike analysis?

**Traffic spike analysis** is the process of investigating sudden increases in network traffic to determine their cause, impact, and whether they represent expected activity, operational issues, or security-related events.

Not every traffic spike is a problem. A scheduled backup, software deployment, product launch, viral event, or DDoS attack can all produce similar traffic increases. Traffic spike analysis helps operators determine why the increase occurred and whether action is required.

By identifying the hosts, applications, conversations, and services responsible for the increase, operators can quickly understand both the cause and operational impact of the event.

## Why is traffic spike analysis important?

Traffic spikes can affect bandwidth availability, application performance, network stability, and user experience.

Without investigation, it is often difficult to determine whether a spike represents expected business activity, growing demand, a configuration issue, abnormal application behavior, or a security-related event.

Traffic spike analysis therefore provides the context needed to distinguish normal activity from conditions that require operational attention.

## Traffic spike analysis in network operations

Traffic spike analysis is commonly used during congestion investigations, bandwidth troubleshooting, capacity-planning exercises, security investigations, and performance monitoring workflows.

Operators typically compare the spike against historical traffic baselines, identify the systems responsible for the increase, examine application behavior, and determine how the event affected network resources.

Historical visibility is especially important because a traffic spike only becomes meaningful when compared against normal network behavior.

## In Trisul

Traffic spike investigations depend heavily on historical visibility because the significance of a traffic increase can only be understood relative to previous behavior.

Trisul Network Analytics helps operators compare traffic spikes against historical baselines, identify the hosts and applications responsible for the increase, analyze bandwidth consumption, and drill into the underlying traffic that caused the event.

Using flow analytics, traffic counters, packet visibility, and historical traffic retention, Trisul helps network and security teams investigate sudden traffic changes, understand their operational impact, and move quickly from detection to root-cause analysis.

For examples of traffic-investigation workflows, see the Trisul documentation:
