# What is LDAP?

**LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** is a protocol used to access and manage directory services that store information about users, groups, devices, applications, and other network resources.

LDAP provides a standardized way for applications and systems to access a centralized directory of identity information. It is widely used as the foundation for centralized authentication, authorization, and identity-management systems.

A useful way to think about LDAP is that it provides a shared directory of identities that multiple systems can use for authentication and access control.

---

## How LDAP works

LDAP organizes information in a hierarchical structure known as a **Directory Information Tree (DIT)**. Objects such as users, groups, devices, servers, and organizational units are stored as directory entries, each containing attributes that describe that object.

Applications communicate with an LDAP server to search for directory information, retrieve user attributes, verify credentials, and manage directory entries.

During authentication, a client typically submits user credentials to the directory service, which validates those credentials against the corresponding directory entry.

Because many applications can access the same directory, organizations can maintain a single source of identity information rather than creating separate user databases for every system.

---

## Directory services vs databases

LDAP directories are often compared to databases, but they are designed for different purposes.

A directory service is optimized for environments where information is queried frequently but updated relatively infrequently. User accounts, group memberships, organizational structures, and device records are typically read far more often than they are modified.

This makes directory services highly efficient for authentication, authorization, user lookups, and identity-management workloads.

In contrast, general-purpose databases are designed for a wider range of read and write operations and are not specifically optimized for identity-centric workloads.

---

## LDAP in network operations

LDAP often serves as the central identity repository for enterprise infrastructure.

Network devices, VPN gateways, monitoring platforms, firewalls, wireless controllers, cloud services, and business applications can authenticate users against a shared directory rather than maintaining separate local user databases.

This simplifies user lifecycle management because accounts, group memberships, and access policies can be managed centrally rather than maintained independently across multiple systems.

As organizations grow, this centralized model helps reduce administrative overhead and improves consistency across authentication and access-control workflows.

---

## Why LDAP is critical infrastructure

Directory services frequently become a foundational component of enterprise operations because many systems depend on them simultaneously.

When LDAP services become unavailable, authentication failures can affect multiple applications, devices, and platforms at the same time. For this reason, directory availability is often treated as a critical operational requirement.

Large deployments typically use redundancy, replication, and failover mechanisms to maintain service continuity and reduce the impact of outages.

This dependence on centralized identity services is one reason why LDAP infrastructure is often considered part of an organization's core operational architecture.

## LDAP vs Active Directory

| Category | LDAP | Active Directory |
|---|---|---|
| Type | Directory access protocol | Directory service platform |
| Primary purpose | Access and manage directory information | Provide centralized identity and directory services |
| Authentication support | Supports authentication queries | Provides authentication and authorization services |
| Data storage | Does not store data itself | Stores users, groups, devices, and policies |
| Vendor dependency | Open standard protocol | Microsoft directory implementation |
| Best fit | Standardized directory access across applications | Enterprise identity and access management environments |

LDAP and Active Directory are often confused because Active Directory uses LDAP as one of its primary access protocols.

LDAP defines how applications communicate with directory services, while Active Directory is a directory service implementation that supports LDAP authentication and directory queries.

---

## Security considerations

Because directory services often contain sensitive identity information and authentication data, security is a critical consideration.

Unencrypted LDAP traffic can expose credentials and directory information to anyone capable of observing network traffic. For this reason, organizations typically use:

- LDAPS (LDAP over SSL/TLS)
- LDAP with StartTLS

Administrative access should be restricted, monitored, and audited because directory services frequently control access to critical enterprise resources.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports LDAP integration for centralized user authentication and account management.

Rather than maintaining separate user credentials within the platform, organizations can authenticate users against an existing enterprise directory service. This helps align access-control policies with established identity-management processes and reduces administrative overhead.

LDAP integration can be used alongside other Trisul security controls such as role-based access control (RBAC), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and AAA-based authentication workflows.

## Frequently asked questions

### Is LDAP the same as Active Directory?

No. LDAP is a protocol used to access and query directory services, while Active Directory is a directory service implementation that supports LDAP. Many directory platforms support LDAP, including Active Directory and OpenLDAP.

### Can LDAP be used for authentication?

LDAP is commonly used to verify user credentials and retrieve identity information from a centralized directory. Applications authenticate users by validating credentials against directory entries stored in an LDAP server.

### What information is stored in an LDAP directory?

LDAP directories commonly store user accounts, groups, organizational units, devices, email addresses, phone numbers, and access-control information. The directory structure is optimized for read-intensive operations rather than frequent updates.

### Why is LDAP preferred for enterprise authentication?

LDAP provides a centralized source of identity information that can be shared across multiple applications and systems. This reduces administrative overhead and helps maintain consistent user access policies across the organization.

### Should LDAP traffic be encrypted?

Yes. Unencrypted LDAP can expose credentials and directory information over the network. Most organizations use LDAPS or LDAP with TLS to protect authentication traffic and directory queries.

### Why is LDAP important in large organizations?

LDAP provides a centralized identity repository that can be shared across many systems, simplifying authentication, user management, and access-control administration while improving operational consistency.
