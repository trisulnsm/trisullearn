# What is cloud monitoring?

**Cloud monitoring** is the process of observing cloud infrastructure, services, workloads, and traffic to track performance, availability, utilization, and security across cloud environments. It provides operators with visibility into how cloud‑based systems behave, how traffic flows between components, and how resources are being consumed.

---

## How cloud monitoring works

Cloud monitoring systems collect telemetry from infrastructure, applications, and network services across cloud environments.  
Common telemetry sources include:

- Metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O, bandwidth)  
- Logs (system and application events)  
- Traces (distributed request flows)  
- Flow telemetry (NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow)  
- Event streams (scaling, failures, configuration changes)  
- Cloud‑provider APIs and monitoring services  

Typical stages:

1. **Telemetry collection** – Agents and exporters gather metrics, logs, traces, and flow data.  
2. **Normalization and aggregation** – Data is structured and rolled up into operational views.  
3. **Analysis and correlation** – Systems detect trends, anomalies, and cross‑layer issues.  
4. **Visualization and alerting** – Dashboards and alerts surface incidents and performance changes.  
5. **Investigation and troubleshooting** – Operators drill into the root cause using correlated telemetry.  

Because cloud environments are elastic and distributed, monitoring must adapt to autoscaling, ephemeral workloads, and multi‑region architectures.

## Cloud monitoring in operations

Cloud monitoring supports operational visibility across infrastructure, applications, and networks. Common use cases include:

- **Performance monitoring** – Detect latency, high response times, and service degradation.  
- **Availability monitoring** – Identify outages, failed services, and unhealthy instances.  
- **Security monitoring** – Spot unusual traffic, brute‑force attempts, and lateral movement.  
- **Capacity and scaling analysis** – Track resource growth and autoscaling events.  
- **Cost optimization** – Identify under‑used or over‑provisioned resources.  
- **Hybrid‑network visibility** – Monitor traffic between cloud and on‑premises environments.  

Cloud‑specific complexity means that operators need correlated telemetry across compute, storage, network, and application layers.

## Common cloud telemetry signals

| Signal          | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| Metrics         | Resource and service‑level performance indicators |
| Logs            | System‑level and application‑level events |
| Traces          | Visibility into distributed request paths |
| Flow telemetry  | Network‑level traffic analysis and top‑talker identification |
| Events          | Infrastructure and orchestration events (create, delete, scale, etc.) |
| Alerts          | Notifications when conditions breach thresholds |

Different platforms combine these signals to give broader operational awareness and observability.

## Cloud monitoring vs cloud observability

| Dimension           | Cloud monitoring                            | Cloud observability                                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary focus       | Tracking known metrics and thresholds       | Understanding system behavior through rich telemetry      |
| Typical data        | Metrics and alerts                          | Metrics, logs, traces, and events                         |
| Operational model   | Detecting predefined conditions             | Investigating complex, distributed‑system behavior        |
| Main goal           | Operational awareness and alerting          | Root‑cause analysis and behavioral insight                |

Cloud observability builds on monitoring by adding deeper correlation and context to distributed‑system telemetry.

## Why cloud monitoring matters

Cloud environments are dynamic, distributed, and often multi‑tenant. Without centralized visibility, operators may struggle to:

- Detect outages quickly  
- Diagnose latency and performance issues  
- Investigate security incidents  
- Understand traffic patterns across regions and providers  
- Control costs tied to cloud usage  

Effective cloud monitoring improves reliability, performance, security, and cost‑efficient resource management. Network‑level traffic visibility is especially important in hybrid and multi‑cloud scenarios where application traffic spans multiple networks and providers.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports cloud‑oriented monitoring workflows through **traffic analytics and flow‑based visibility** across cloud‑connected and hybrid environments.  
Relevant capabilities include:

- **Flow‑based traffic analytics** using NetFlow, IPFIX, and sFlow to see traffic between cloud and on‑premises segments.  
- **Hybrid‑network visibility** across cloud‑providers, regions, and data centers.  
- **Historical traffic trending** to detect gradual changes or growth patterns.  
- **Top‑K analytics** to identify the largest cloud‑or‑cloud‑connected traffic consumers.  
- **Explore Flows** for drill‑down investigation into specific conversations and anomalies.  
- **Aggregate Flows** for summarizing traffic behavior by subnet, service, or region.  

These features help operators analyze cloud‑related traffic, detect anomalies, and improve operational awareness across distributed infrastructures.
