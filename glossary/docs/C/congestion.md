# What is congestion in network analytics?

**Congestion** is a network condition where traffic demand exceeds available forwarding or transmission capacity, causing queues to grow, latency and jitter to increase, packets to be dropped, and effective throughput to fall. It is one of the most common causes of degraded application performance and poor user experience.

---

## How congestion works

Congestion occurs when traffic arrives at a link, interface, or device faster than it can be forwarded. Packets are held in queues and buffers, which increases latency and jitter. As load grows further, buffers may fill and packets may be dropped, triggering TCP retransmissions and further load. Short bursts can be absorbed, but sustained congestion usually indicates a capacity or traffic‑distribution issue.

---

## Congestion in network operations

In enterprise, ISP, and cloud environments, congestion analysis helps explain slow applications, poor voice/video quality, and intermittent failures. Operators use it to detect overloaded links, validate traffic‑engineering and QoS policies, and plan capacity upgrades. Congestion often appears during peak usage, large transfers, backups, cloud sync, or unexpected traffic spikes.

---

## Common congestion symptoms

| Symptom              | Meaning |
|----------------------|---------|
| High utilization     | Link or interface is heavily loaded |
| Queue buildup        | Packets waiting in buffers |
| Packet loss          | Buffers or forwarding paths overwhelmed |
| Increased latency    | Packets take longer to traverse the network |
| Jitter               | Delay variation affects real‑time traffic |
| TCP retransmissions  | Lost packets being resent |
| Reduced throughput   | Effective delivery rate drops |

These signals are best interpreted together rather than in isolation.

## Congestion vs high utilization

| Dimension          | Congestion                                 | High utilization                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Meaning            | Service‑impacting overload condition       | High percentage of bandwidth usage        |
| Impact             | Causes delay, loss, and degradation        | May still operate normally                |
| Typical indicators | Queueing, loss, latency, retransmissions  | Interface counters only                   |
| Operational concern| Performance degradation                    | Capacity consumption                      |

A heavily utilized link is not always congested, and congestion can occur even with moderate average utilization if traffic is bursty.

## Why congestion matters

Unmanaged congestion leads to higher latency, jitter, and packet loss, which degrade applications and services. It increases the risk of user dissatisfaction, intermittent outages, and inefficient resource use. Monitoring congestion helps detect bottlenecks, validate QoS and traffic engineering, and plan upgrades more accurately. Historical analysis is useful because congestion often recurs on specific paths or time windows.

## In Trisul

Trisul supports congestion‑oriented analysis through flow‑based telemetry (NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow), interface utilization visibility, and historical trending. It shows which hosts, applications, or ASes drive traffic on overloaded links, and Top‑K analytics and Explore Flows help drill into high‑volume flows and recurring congestion patterns. This helps operators identify where congestion occurs and what is causing it.
